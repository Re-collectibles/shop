All trout fishermen will enjoy this book by one of New Zealand’s best known anglers, R. E. (“Bob”) Cuthbertson. He has succeeded in his aim of writing something that is interesting, instructive, and at the same time humorous. Hints on the best way to catch trout in the waters Mr Cuthbertson has come to know so well are illustrated by accounts of amusing incidents encountered during a lifetime of fishing. 

To conclude the book there is a chapter in verse devoted to, the death of a favorite dog, ‘Major’, who accompanied the author on many a fishing jaunt. Well-known anglers who read the book before publication are full of praise for it.

He takes us from his childhood to the height of his fame as 'Mr Motor Racing' and then to the sudden end of his career with that crash at Goodwood in 1962. Along the way we dwell on his finest moments as well as the setbacks, and delight in the sheer variety of machinery - almost 100 different cars - in which he competed during his rollercoaster racing life. This is a book that all motor racing enthusiasts will treasure.

Between 1863 and 1971 the steam locomotive was the best known part of railways, and these steel kings of the steel road touched everyone's lives. Stories abound regarding the steam locomotive and what made them special. 

This is a history of the steam locomotives owned by New Zealand's national railway system. Numbering more than a thousand, they were enormously varied - ranging from little over five tons to almost 148 tons in weight, and from the occasional failure to trend-setting designs of international significance. 

This stunning book combines the best available research with the largest collection of photographs on the subject ever assembled. The book is not the full story of each class; that would be an impossible task given the limits of a single volume. Each locomotive is described by class beginning at A and ending at Y with brief specifications, builders and years built and operated begin each section. The text then describes the circumstances that led to the acquisition or building of the class, the type of work they performed, significant modifications made, the decline and withdrawal of each class, and the existence of any preserved examples. 

Along the way we are informed about the basic structure of the NZR numbering system and the variations made over the years. Interesting mention is made of average annual mileages run by the various classes, and the running cost per mile travelled. Locomotives that did not receive a classification by NZR and steam railcars are also covered. The illustrations form a vital part of this volume.

 They have been sourced from a variety of collections, and they support the text fully.

 This lavishly illustrated and very informative book will soon become an essential reference work for all interested in the railways of New Zealand.

In 1844 the Auckland firm of Henderson & Macfarlane swapped a ship for some 18,000 acres of land west of Auckland. 

Thomas Maxwell Henderson, the senior partner and a hard-nosed Scotsmen, then proceeded to cut the tall kauri timber from the Waitakere Ranges and mill it at Henderson's Mill on Henderson Creek. 

After the mill closed in 1868, many came and left, but some stayed behind to build a life and eventually even a town. 

And that town became known as Henderson. Exploring the period 1840 to 1939, in this book you will read about Thomas Henderson; the Macfarlanes; William Swanson; John and Helen McLeod; George Thomas the blacksmith; Robert Gibbons the Whatipu mill owner; the Corban family of winegrowers; Don Buck digging gum at Massey/Swanson; Henry Swan's arch; Claude Brookes and his Tui Glen playground; the Henderson Mill Turf Club; the Henderson Football Club; The Henderson School; the Henderson Library; the Henderson Fire Brigade; the Falls Hotel; the Waitemata Electric Power Board; and many of the people, families and institutions of the west.

There was a romance about railways in the days of steam that made legends of the trains and the men who ran them.

 Little of Australia's workaday or social life was not affected by the lonesome whistle that winkled its way into every corner of the land. 
A train whistle; the sound that probably more than any other sound on earth has caused boys to run away from home, to become footloose and long for faraway places.

Patsy Adam-Smith rode the rails to Marble Bar in Western Australia on the 'Spinifex Flyer'; the line from Normanton to Croyden, isolated in Queensland's Gulf country, the tiny mountain lines in Tasmania's southwest, past the Montezuma Falls where water sprayed over the tracks; and the long, straight line across the Nullarbor's semi-desert. 

She brings alive the railway folk who were proud to belong to the great family of railway workers the drivers who only took leave when their engines were due for overhaul, the station masters and mistresses isolated on lonely lines, and the fettlers who took pride in being able to swing a 28-pound hammer when the temperature was 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade. 

This book captures the magic of days when life had more meaning, fellowship and certainty...

The story begins with a glimpse of the region's origins and then proceeds to show how man impacted on it. At first the valley was to the Maoris and the early Europeans a routeway.

The latter, however, soon recognized its farming potential and for almost a century the area was essentially rural in character. The coming of the railway raised hopes for closer settlement but this had to await the faster, electrified deviation and the conclusion of wars and depressions. By 1951 there were enough people in Tawa to undertake responsibility for its own development and in 1953 their ability to do so was confirmed by the grant of borough status. From then on the story is one of steady and continual progress  achieved by good planning, careful budgeting and a large measure of voluntary input.

More recently, in the 1820s, Ngati Toa and Ngati Awa migrated to Waikanae, led by Te Rauparaha. 



The opening of the Wellington-Manawatu railway in 1886 brought pakeha settlers to work in the timber and flaxmilling industries and to clear the land for farming. Since World War II Waikanae has flourished as a leisure and retirement centre, its population exploding as new residents and holidaymakers have flocked to the Kapti Coast. 

In this book Chris & Joan Maclean have created a vivid and interesting picture of Waikanae past and present. Part 1 of the book focuses on Waikanae's social history, both Maori and Pakaha, while part two is concerned with the landscape and ecology of the area and with changes in land use over the years.

This is the saga of stem and steel in a new country. It begins in 1863, when New Zealand’s tiny scattered settlements lay weeks apart in terms of travel time and when, fortunately, the arts of railway making were beginning to bear good fruit. 

The young country’s irregular surface posed tricky problems for surveyors, engineers and the men who designed and drove the locomotives. But the boundless confidence and enthusiasm of the visionary premier Julius Vogel inspired the work; and by the end of Victoria’s reign New Zealand’s railways were approaching the zenith of their development.

A great load of information - and blueprints 


The Story of the Kingston Flyer is one that had to be written some time, and it is just my good luck that I happen to be the one to tell it and to be assisted in the telling by such a dedicated team. I have also to acknowledge with thanks permission to quote from R. J. Meyer’s book “All Aboard” written for the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society, and extracts from newspaper articles and books by the late J. 0.
Watt have also been of assistance. 

The account of Grace Richards’s experiences as a child growing up by the railway town of Lumsden first appeared in “Open Country” edited by Jim Henderson.

 I am indebted to Mrs Richards for her permission to reprint this memoir which is so much a part of the history of the Kingston Flyer. Some information for this book has also been obtained from G. A. Hamilton’s “Northern Southland”. I have also quoted from my own book, “Golden Days of Lake County”. To Barry Brickell, of Coromandel, potter and steam train enthusiast, I am indebted for the time “Fascination of Steam”, and I also acknowledge with thanks material that has been made available to me by Russell Glendinning, driver of the Flyer. Finally I would express my thanks to Mr T. A. McGavin, publicity and advertising manager, N.Z. Railways, for his co-operation and for the use of a selection of photographs from his records, and to Mr I. B. Gordon, former Minister of Railways, for his ready response to my request for his account of his discussions with Mr Ivan Thomas, former general manager of Railways, that led to the establishment of the present Kingston

In April 2018 the stars aligned and Sarah Gallagher, of the Dunedin Flat Names Project, and Dr Ian Chapman, Senior Lecturer in Performing Arts at the University of Otago, teamed up to create Scarfie Flats of Dunedin – a highly colourful and pictorial work featuring a fine, witty, sometimes edgy, selection of Dunedin’s well known and less well known named flats.

 Featuring a selection of back stories of flats, photos and associated ephemera, as well as chapters by subject matter experts, readers will appreciate the changing scene of student culture and society in Dunedin from the 1930s to the present.

Mr Grainger describes the many sides to railway life. He was cleaner, shunt fireman, main line fireman, and first grade driver. He writes about steam engines and their temperamental ways, tells stories about the characters of the railway service, and comment, often bluntly, on the administration of New Zealand Railways.

Grand Old Days of Steam by W. W. Stewart. ""The steam locomotive,"" writes W. W. (Bill) Stewart ""was the most human machine invented by man"" - the reason no doubt why those ""iron horses"" stirred so many imaginations during their time on earth and, since their general demise, have left so many memories.

 To a far greater degree than achieved by any other means of mechanical transport the steam locomotive became an integral part of life for several generations of New Zealanders during the nineteenth and much of the present century. It carried them to school and work, transported them on holidays and to distant relations, and, most importantly, served to bring the country closer together, joining town and country.

The Old Whaling Days is the story of New Zealand's wildest days, when French and American ships as well as British scoured the coastline for the highly-prized sperm whale; when violent crimes went unpunished because there were no laws; when a British sea captain helped Te Ruaparaha to slaughter an Akaroa chief and his people. 

Robert McNab travelled the world in his search for the letters, newspaper articles and ships' logs which make this an eye-witness account of the most interesting, but least recorded, period of New Zealand's history

They travelled across the world in search of a new life, a piece of land to call their own. They came, too, in their thousands, to dig gold. 

Many of the young women came to work as servants in the homes of those more wealthy than themselves; the men often earned a living building bridges, tunnels and railways until they could afford a farm of their own. Some came as priests and nuns to teach and care for their fellow countrymen and women. 

The Irish who poured into NZ, particularly as assisted immigrants in the last third of the 19th century, have left an indelible mark of this country's history- and on its people: it is estimated that an astonishing 20 per cent of NZ's population can claim Irish ancestry. A Lucky Landing tells of the colourful Irish men and women who have played a part in NZ's politics, in its literature, in its commercial success

There are chapters on the Irish goldminers, on the battles between Orange and Green that were once fought fiercely in this country, on the Irish influence on the Catholic church, on the many Irish who became publicans or policemen, and on the discrimination suffered by the Irish immigrants in the days before being Irish was a matter of pride

Published in 2007

With the economic depression of the 1870s stalling progress, the New Zealand Government turned to Scandinavia for help. 

Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes (lumbermen, farmers and carpenters) arrived to take up the challenge of clearing bush from Wairarapa, Manawatu, and Hawkes Bay so roads and railways could be built.

In 1866, Swede Bror Erik Friberg and his young wife arrive to this scene and Bror Erik was soon appointed by the government to act as an agent with a focus on the Scandinavian settlers in Hawkes Bay.

Margit Brew tells of Bror Erik's early life in Sweden and the concerns for the difficulties his countrymen face. Having arrived heavily in debt to the government these immigrants strive to survive in a country where nobody speaks their language and where there is plenty of sickness and little or no medical care.

 In February 1943 a group of Japanese prisoners of war apparently mutinied in a camp at Featherson, in the southern part of New Zealand's North Island. Guards fired, and 48 prisoners were killed.

Early Bridges in New Zealand 1830-1939

This book describes bridges still in use like the Makatote Viaduct and the Awatere River road and railway bridge, important bridges that have been replaced, like the Waitaki road and railway bridge in the South Island, and those that have been retained for special interest, like the Percy Burn Viaduct used by trampers on the Hump Track in the Waitutu Forest in Southland.

The author gives clear descriptions of the designs and of the circumstances of their construction. The text is amply illustrated with 270 photographs of interesting bridges from the north to the south of New Zealand, both bridges still in use and some that no longer exist.

Structure of the book
The book begins with an overview of the development of bridge building mainly in England and New Zealand and then each chapter deals with a different type of bridge structure - beam and girder, truss, suspension, cantilever, movable and arch bridges.

Geoffrey Thornton includes both old bridges still in use and some that have since been replaced, bridges on main highways or country roads, bridges in town and country, well-known bridges and some seemingly insignificant bridges that have attracted his connoisseur's eye and become of interest on reading about their design and their history.

The New Zealand Government Railways inaugurated its first electrified section of main-line railway between Otira and Arthur's Pass on the South Island's Midland Line on August 4, 1923, 

The locomotives used on this section were possibly the first main line electrics ever built by English Electric, a recent amalgamation of large electrical firms including Dick Kerr, known for the building of tramcars, at whose works the engines were built. 


These locomotives, confined as they were to a restricted and out-of-the way area, have received scant attention in railway literature, yet they were in many respects as historically important, aesthetically appealing and as remarkable in performance as many a more numerous and ubiquitous class of steam or diesel engine, as this booklet hopes to show.

The gang's ringleader, originally known as Richard Hill, had been transported from London to Melbourne for theft at the age of 16, arriving in 1847. After his release he resumed a life of crime and served several prison terms. By October 1861 he was calling himself Burgess, the name of a New South Wales runholder he had attempted to steal from. In January 1862 he left Australia for the Otago goldfields, where he again turned to crime, teaming up with Thomas Noon, an acquaintance from his prison days in Australia. Their specialty was attacking and robbing lone prospectors.

In March 1862 Sergeant-Major Bracken and members of the Otago Mounted Police attempted to bring Burgess and Noon in for questioning over a robbery at Weatherstones on the Otago goldfields. The pair escaped amid gunfire but were eventually captured. Despite their claims that Noon's gun had gone off accidentally, they received three and a half years' hard labour in Dunedin Gaol. Burgess was outraged at this sentence. He received 36 lashes for his role in an attempted escape while in prison and vowed to take revenge on society by taking a life for every lash he received. ....

To the early settlers, frequently living in tents on the river banks, the Avon was the only source of water until seven artesian wells were sunk in Christchurch in 1864. The Avon waters were used by the Christchurch Fire Brigade, and cart-loads of water weaken to settle dust on the rough city streets.

The City Mill, on the island adjacent to the Hereford Street bridge, the Riccarton mill and the corn mill (commemorated in Carlton Mill Road) provided flour for bread.

Horses were watered, carts washed, people bathed, trout were taken by the basketful from inner reaches; rowing clubs built boatsheds and canoeists took their pleasure.

In From the Banks of the Avon local historian Robert C. Lamb brings history to life by recapturing the mood of the times, frequently drawing on contemporary accounts. He tells of bridges new and old, and events exciting, enterprising, humorous and at times - sadly moving in this very readable and superbly illustrated book.

All at Sea is the fascinating life-story of naval sailor Jack Harker. In his best-selling previous works, including Well Done Leander and HMNZS Achilles, he told of specific times in his naval career, and he was later awarded the QSM for his service in recording New Zealand naval history.

 Now, in All at Sea, he tells his whole life story. Born in 1916 in Governors Bay, his mother died in the 1918 influenza epidemic, and he survived an alcoholic stepmother and a lively childhood of getting into and out of trouble in Christchurch, to sign on as a trainee radio operator with the NZ navy. 

He served on a number of ships, including both Leander and Achilles, which both saw active service in WWII. After leaving the navy, he worked in a variety of occupations, including farming in Northland, and for the NZBC, before settling on civil engineering. In 1972, he was part of the Greenpeace protest fleet sailing to Mururoa on the yacht Tamure, with Maurice Shadbolt.

From 1906 to 1925 Quail Island, in Lyttelton Harbour, was the site of New Zealand’s leprosy colony.

 The colony began by accident, as it were, after the discovery of a leprosy sufferer in Christchurch. As further patients arrived from across the country, it grew into a controversial and troubled institution – an embarrassment to the Health Department, an object of pity to a few, a source of fear to many.

This remarkable narrative reveals a little-known aspect of New Zealand’s past, shedding light on the treatment of some of society’s most marginal, unfortunate and isolated people. Written in lucid, compelling prose, The Dark Island heralds the arrival of a significant historical voice.

 Or so the story of Colditz has gone, unchallenged for 70 years. But that tale contains only part of the truth. 

The astonishing inside story, revealed for the first time in this instant bestseller by historian Ben Macintyre, is a tale of the indomitable human spirit, but also one of class conflict, homosexuality, espionage, insanity and farce. 

Through an astonishing range of material, Macintyre reveals a remarkable cast of characters, wider than previously seen and hitherto hidden from history, taking in prisoners and captors who were living cheek-by-jowl in a thrilling game of cat and mouse. From the elitist members of the Colditz Bullingdon Club to America's oldest paratrooper and least successful secret agent, the soldier-prisoners of Colditz were courageous and resilient as well as vulnerable and fearful -- and astonishingly imaginative in their desperate escape attempts.

 Deeply researched and full of incredible human stories, this is the definitive book on Colditz.

Breaking fresh ground, this new and important biography of Sir Edmund Hillary stands apart from previous accounts of this truly great New Zealander. The author, Michael Gill, was a close friend of Edmund Hillary’s for nearly 50 years, accompanying him on many expeditions, and becoming heavily involved in his Himalayan aid work. He was also granted access by Sir Edmund’s children to a large archive of private papers and photos that were deposited in the Auckland Museum after his death.

Building on this unpublished material, as well as his extensive personal experience, Michael Gill has written an insightful and illuminating biography. He describes the uncertainties of the first 33 years of Edmund Hillary’s life, as well as the background to the first ascent of Mt Everest, a feat that brought him instant worldwide fame. In addition, this biography reveals the pivotal and loving relationship he had with his wife Louise, in part through their touching letters to each other. Her importance to him during their 22 years of marriage only underlines the horror of her death, along with that of their youngest daughter, in a plane crash in 1975. Edmund Hillary eventually pulled out of his subsequent depression to continue his life’s work building schools and hospitals in the Himalayas.

Affectionate, but scrupulously fair, Michael Gill has gone further than anyone before to reveal the humanity of this remarkable man. Edmund Hillary’s life was shaped by both triumph and tragedy, and while he became famous through his mountaineering achievements, it was his humility and affection for the people of Nepal that became an equal part of his enduring legacy.

Buildings & Bridges of Christchurch
Much of New Zealand's architectural past
disappears with demolition and re-
development. Now more than ever, many
of Christchurch's wooden, brick and

stone buildings, which are an integral part
of its character, are under pressure from
the more efficient, but in many cases,
characterless high rise developments.

Gwenda Turner's drawings record with
meticulous detail her favourite buildings
and bridges. The photographs which she
has chosen from various archives show
the subjects as they appeared about the
turn of the century.

Sixty-seven drawings by the author,
together with a selection of over ninety
photographs, many of which have never
been published, make up this attractive
book.

A humble Maori youth who was lionised as a prince by London society. 
The wealthy ‘Radical Jack’, who thought it ‘damned hard that a man with £8o,ooo a year can’t sleep . . 
New Zealand’s first town planner, who from his London office planned a dream city on the Hutt River, complete with Billingsgate Fish Market and President’s Palace! 

These are some of the people, characters of varying importance in the story of New Zealand, who come to life in Curtain-raiser to a Colony. Readers of The Dominion will have met many of them before, for the historical sketches contributed to that newspaper by Cecil and Celia Manson have a wide and loyal readership. The Mansons are often asked, ‘When are these articles going to appear in book form?’ As answer, here is an instalment. 

A question even more frequently put to the Mansons is, ‘How can two people write together? How do you do it?’ The answer, say the authors, is that although one may have written most of an article or story, the result is the work of both: they share in the research and they edit each other’s work. This mutual editing, they say, is invaluable and a tremendous time-saver. And each is the other’s severest critic.

Joan Bullock Morrell: Sculptor, written by Wanganui-based author Valerie Cowan, is a lavishly-illustrated book which examines Joan's inspiration for each of her sculptures and takes the reader through the creative process of sculpting. Joan is recognised as being at the forefront of sculpting in New Zealand – a medium she has pursued since the 1960s.

Born in Wanganui in 1928, Joan received the New Zealand Commemoration Medal in 1990 in recognition of services to the country. In 1995 she was awarded the Queen’s Service Medal. She has been commissioned by Wanganui to produce sculptures for the community and currently she is working on a commissioned James K Baxter sculpture for Wanganui’s Guyton Street. Joan has a private gallery on a Wanganui property which is open to the public when requested. The gallery showcases approximately 60 sculptures. 

‘I don’t ever draw what I am going to make. If I did then it would be done and I wouldn’t need to make a sculpture. I just have it in my head and I do it. I can see it in my mind better than I can draw.’

Valerie Cowan is no stranger to telling the stories of extraordinary New Zealanders. Her previous books include Pigs and Me: Tales of the Bygone Bush, Goodness Gracious Me: Pioneering Stories from Five Nzers and Bridging the Centuries. To write Joan Bullock Morrell: Sculptor, Valerie spent countless hours listening to and interviewing Joan. The result is the impressive story of an artist who in her eighties continues to work and has her work in private collections in Europe, Asia and North America. Her sculptures have also enchanted visitors to Wanganui’s public spaces including Kowhai Park and Virginia Lake.

The Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) was instituted in 1854 and is the oldest British award for gallantry. It was awarded to non commissioned officers and other ranks of the Army for distinguished conduct in the field. Over 500 DCMs have been awarded to New Zealanders.
This is an account of the New Zealand recipients of the Distinguished Conduct Medal from the earliest times of the South African war to the present time; together with brief biographical notes and details of their entitlement to other Medals, Orders and Decorations.
An invaluable tool for researchers and regarded as the definitive work in this area.

On her second visit in 1908, she investigated the mountains in more detail, and met the chief guide at the Hermitage, Peter Graham.

Graham introduced her to mountain climbing, and added existing experience of ropework, snow and ice climbing to her existing skills on rock. At a time when mountaineering itself was a rare pastime, Freda Du Faur's enthusiasm and perseverance enabled mountain guides to explore their own opportunities to make challenging ascents. She found the challenge of mountaineering a source of considerable enjoyment and freedom. Given strictures on Edwardian women, it may have also provided a welcome escape from many of her frustrations with family and society

Although she did not live in New Zealand, Du Faur was the leading amateur climber of her day. She also has enduring significance as the first active female high mountaineer in New Zealand. Today, in the main divide of the Southern Alps, Du Faur, Pibrac and Cadogan Peaks are named in memory of this pioneering mountaineer, the Du Faur family house and her devoted lover.

By A.W. Beasley 


Each of the five quarter-centuries which followed has displayed a specific character: in the first the young institution was buffeted about, first by frequent changes of abode and then, even on its present site, by as frequent upheavals in its administration. In the active 25 years of Firth's time as headmaster, he and the school grew together in reputation, and the school in size - Firth was already a physical giant. 
The third period was one in which depression and another war mocked the hopes of 1918, and at the end of it the school was even dispossessed of its home; yet by the centennial year 1967 the school and its surroundings might have seemed to a returning Old Boy to be utterly secure. 
It was not to be, of course: 1968 saw an end of stability, for Wellington College as for the wider world; so that this latest quarter-century has become one of often painful rebuilding. 

It is the people and events of those years who appear in these pages, the crises and conflicts, the growth of a school community in the broadest sense; the sharing of the light to which the school motto refers, and the passing on of that light from generation to generation.

The First World War was a conflict of unprecedented ferocity. After the last shot was fired and the troops marched home, approximately three million soldiers remained unaccounted for. An unassuming English chaplain first proposed a symbolic burial in memory of all the missing dead; subsequently the idea was picked up by almost every combatant country. 

Acclaimed author Neil Hanson focuses on the lives of three soldiers — an Englishman, a German, and an American — using their diaries and letters to offer an unflinching yet compassionate account of the front lines. He describes how each man endured nearly unbearable conditions, skillfully showing how the Western world arrived at the now time-honored way of mourning and paying tribute to all those who die in war.",FALSE,,TRUE,10.00,10.00,16.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,5 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;14.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;0.0=Pick up No Cost;1.0=Postage after paying full post on the first item;2.0=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,scan_20170530 (3).jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"1st week 27 JAN - FEB 2",FALSE,FALSE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

Fifty years of kiwi musicians blamming out the beat - rock 'n' roll, pop, mod, country, folk, heavy metal, soul, punk, new wave, garage, funk, hip hop, techno - that rocks the nation. From wild Kiwi garage to deep in the Pacific of bass, from C'mon to slice of heaven, this is the story of our sound, told from its beginnings with the likes of the shirt-ripping Johnny Devlin through to the proud and sophisticated music industry of today.

Jammed full of photos, and with a colourful and exuberant text, the publishing of this book is extremely timely. It is over 15 years since the last survey of New Zealand rock music appeared, and with New Zealand music getting unprecendented coverage through radio and TV airtime, industry promotion, documentaries and the following of a large and dedicated audience, Ready to Fly is truly a book that is tapping into the pulse.

This is an historical analysis of a century of nursing in Rotorua. The result is a fascinating account of trained and untrained nurses, as well as doctors and bureaucrats and patients and health services, in a place of dramatic landscapes, with acclaimed healing powers associated with its water and mud.

The book reveals that period of 1840 to 1940 was a time of constant change for nursing – training programmes, registration, professional aspirations, interprofessional tensions, restructuring of health services, wars and peace, epidemics and new therapies.

‘This book is an attempt to carry on the story of the high country through the life of one family and one property and through my own involvement in the modernisation of high-country pastoral farming, preserving it, as little changed as  possible, for future generations, writes David McLeod, who is well established as a gifted chronicler of life in the South lsland’s high country. In Many a Glorious Morning and Kingdom in the Hills he told of coming to New Zealand in the 1920s and eventually (in 1930) buying the historic Grasmere and adjoining Cora Lynn runs in the country of the Waimakariri. 

Down From the Tnssock Ranges takes up the narrative in the early years of World War II, at a time when high-country runholders from Marlborough to Southland were developing a sense of community and co-operation. Their way of life was threatened by falling production and an inequitable rent system and by charges of having by mismanagement brought about erosion in the high country.

 There was a need to unite and present a common case to Government. David McLeod was a leader of the group which evolved into the High Country Committee of Federated Farmers, and the inside story of how they learnt to stalk the corridors of power makes absorbing reading. Wartime brought problems to the high country a drastic shortage of manpower , and machinery. There was a humorous side to things too, in the Wild West antics of the Guide Platoons especially formed to preserve us from potential invaders.

The popularity of the fighter aircraft used in World War II is huge in New Zealand, as evidenced by the enormous crowds that turn up for events such as Warbirds over Wanaka - over 80,000 people attended the 2010 event. 

New Zealand is extremely lucky that there is a wide range of airworthy WWII-era classic fighters remaining in the country, the subject of this superb book of aviation photography. Author Gavin Conroy has had unparalleled access to New Zealand's classic fighters, and specialises in close-up air-to-air photography, which captures so much of the character and appeal of these extraordinary machines.

 Included in this pocket edition of the large format book, originally published in 2011, is all of the important aircraft flying in New Zealand. Included are the Supermarine Spitfire, the P-51D Mustang, the P-40 Kittyhawk, the FG-1D Corsair, the Hawker Hurricane, the P-40B Tomahawk, the Yak 3, the Lavochkin La-9, and importantly Germany's great fighter, the Focke Wulf 190.

Fighting with the Enemy New Zealand POWs and the Italian Resistance  by Susan Jacobs 

Paperback, 2003

271 pages


In 1943 Italy surrendered to the Allies, and Germany's reaction was to punish Italy severely for this. The Italian Resistance movement was born, almost overnight. 

Thousands of Kiwis were in prisoner-of-war camps dotted all over Italy, desperately trying to survive until the Allies reached them. Over 450 Kiwis saw escape as their only means of survival, and the partisans and civilians of Italy, former enemies, provided a pathway to a precarious safety. Some of the unlucky ones were captured by the Germans again, tortured and killed.

 This is the story of a unique encounter during World War II between men and women from two very different cultures, from opposite sides of the world. It traces the stories of New Zealand prisoners of war and their experiences alongside Italian peasants and partisans, including the stories of two New Zealand priests who worked from inside the Vatican organising hiding and refuges for prisoners.

Perhaps the greatest leader of men during the Gallipoli campaign, Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Malone was commanding officer of the Wellington Battalion of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force at Gallipoli.

 He is probably the best-known individual from that ill-fated campaign, a result both of his humanity and his superb leadership, which culminated in the successful assault on Chunuk Bair on 8 August 1915. 

Malone was killed later that day. 'No Better Death' reproduces Malone's impressive and often moving correspondence and writings, as well as many striking photographs generously provided by Malone's descendants.

 Malone was a gifted writer and a keen observer, and his letters reveal a shrewd military intelligence and genuine care for his men.

New cases of malaria affect more than one hundred million people each year, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.

Home Textile Crafts Of The 1930s-1950s New Zealand

by Rosemary McLeod

While knitting and sewing were commonplace household jobs, they did provide house-bound women with opportunities for creative expression. Many took pride in their ability to dress their children and themselves in well-made clothes. 

Less immediately practical crafts like embroidery were used to beautify a wide range of items, from handkerchiefs to tablecloths. Women of limited means could create pleasing home interiors using their needles and sewing machines. 

The craftwork of very skilled women had artistic qualities, though it was rarely seen as fine art because of its domestic origins.

 Now out-of-print and hard-to-find. Rosemary McLeod has one of New Zealand's largest collections of women's handcrafts. 

It includes items made by her great grandmother, grandmother and mother. 

She began collecting other objects about 20 years ago, which she found in thrift shops: they seemed to tell a story she knew from her own background....

Alex Gale lives in Taupo, just minutes from some of the best hunting available in New Zealand today.

 A dedicated hunter he has been successful with trophy animals on many occasions, including possibly the best Rusa to be shot in the past ten years, but as the titles suggest, the big ones don't come easy. Sika, Red deer and Rusa are the main species hunted in this book along with observations and advice from a very successful hunter.

This is the hilarious account of a young man growing up in the outback in the 1950s 

Bob Flatt brings to life many of his hair-raising adventures and the characters he met along the way. It tells of a world before technology took over, when each cattle station was its own self-contained community, drovers still roamed the land and the spirit of mateship was a matter of life and death.

Major was a white bull terrier and an Australian by birth. He was given as a pup to Errol Williams, a New Zealand cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and emigrated to New Zealand with his master in 1938. After war was declared in 1939 Captain Williams was appointed to the Special Force, which was then being formed, and eventually became adjutant of 19 (Infantry) Battalion.

Major was a dog of no rank at this stage, but when he too joined the Special Force he was registered as No. 1 New Zealand Dog. He paraded through Wellington with his unit before it left for the Middle East and listened patiently to the good wishes of Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage at a gathering in Parliament grounds.

Captain Williams and Major arrived in Egypt with their unit in February 1940 and trained at Maadi Camp. They were then sent into the Western Desert for the long, hot and dusty business of digging the Baggush Box. Major, still a young dog, eagerly took part in this work.

When the Germans invaded Crete in 1941, taking thousands of Allied prisoners, little could they have known what an irritation one of them would be. Young N.Z. soldier, Sandy Thomas, was severely wounded and unable to be evacuated with his comrades. The first aid post where he was lying was first bombed, then captured by German paratroopers and Sandy was sent to a Prisoner of War hospital in Greece. From here, despite his gaping leg wound, he made several daring attempts at escape.
All, including one in which he feigned death so he could be carried out of the camp in a coffin, were unsuccessful. Finally, his nuisance value became so great that he was sent to a specially guarded camp at Salonika. From here he achieved his amazing escape followed by nearly a year trying to avoid recapture.
He found shelter on the famous Holy Mountain - a rocky peninsula populated solely by monks, where no female had been allowed for hndreds of years. He was shuffled constantly from one monastery to another as the Germans came and went in their search. Some monasteries were generous and hospitable to the young Kiwi, while other were hostile and afraid.
Ass the while, Thomas was impatiently searching for an opportunity to rejoin his regiment. Eventually, thanks to his zest for life and adventure, he reached Turkey in a stolen boat - setting the scene for another amazing story told for the first time in this edition

4 Stroke Handbook

The new alternative for model engines

After nearly half a century of dominance, the 2 stroke engine is rapidly being replaced by the 4 stroke engine for model aircraft power plants. Modellers have been quick to see the advantages of low noise levels, economy, high torque and low RPM operation and sheer joy of ownership of these superb examples of modern engineering mass-production.

This book aims to help the practical model aircraft flyer to operate his chosen model in a safe and reliable manner giving details of starting and running, mounting in the model, fuel formulation, care and maintenance and adjustment for best performance.

Not content with simply giving the 'hows' of the situation, Bill Burkinshaw is at pains to give clear and logical explanations of the 'whys'.

The book is based on extensive experience of RC modelling and the handling of model engines through many years of sport and competition modelling.

Bill Burkinshaw is an active modeller in the field of RC model aircraft and has taken part in national and international competitions.

He has been modelling for 35 years and for 9 years worked as Editor of RC M & E magazine, a world leader in model hobby publications.",FALSE,,TRUE,20.00,20.00,20.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,5 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;14.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;0.0=Pick up No Cost;1.0=Postage after paying full post on the first item;2.0=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2022-04-24 13.21.54.jpg;2022-04-24 13.22.01.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"Historical records",FALSE,FALSE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

Early Days in Central Otago chronicles the intrepid journeys of gold seekers and pastoral pioneers who traversed rugged landscapes a century ago.

Through a blend of eyewitness anecdotes and period photographs, Gilkison paints a vivid picture of the hardships, triumphs, and colourful characters that shaped this remote New Zealand region.
Each chapter unfolds a new tale of discovery—from the first gold rush camps to the establishment of sheep runs—highlighting the grit and spirit of those “adventurers” who carved out a place in Central Otago’s history.

An Account of Brave Endeavour, Disappiontment, and Achivevement North of Auckland on the Shores of the Kaipara Harbour

EMIGRATION OF EIGHT HUNDRED NONCONFORMISTS TO NEW ZEALAND blared the headline in the Illustrated London News of June 7th, 1862. “The London Docks were thronged at an early hour on Thursday week by an immense concourse of persons assembled to witness the departure of the first instalment, about eight hundred persons, chiefly members of different Nonconformist bodies, who are emigrating to the new colony of Albertland, New Zealand.”

Of those who came with the intention of being part of the Nonconformist settlement scheme, only about half actually went to the Albertland area, and of these less than half remained to pioneer the district.

It didn’t take the Albertlanders long to work out that they had been abandoned in a wilderness. 

Their block consisted of scrub and fern, there was no road—anywhere—and seafarers didn’t want a bean of their custom if it meant sailing into the dreaded Kaipara Harbor. Word trickled back to the brethren waiting in Auckland, many of whom turned their backs on the whole thing, cut their losses and took jobs in town.

Wanganui's Castlecliff is often referred to as the 'Cinderella Suburb'. There has been very little written on Castlecliff and archival collections boast few photographs. For the last few decades Castlecliff gave mariners, traders and immigrants their first look of Wanganui. In later years this small seaside area served as a health and seaside resort, then became home to a host of people who lived, loved and died there. Laraine Sole records the threads of their memories in this history of the area.

Scarcely anybody now asks if motor cars are really necessary, but a few people still mange to live without owning or driving them.

 Monte Holcroft admits that this apartness can be a form of second-class citizenship. But he is not sure that a first-class life (or what is taken to be one in our mobile society) is worth having.

 He has been thinking about motor cars, and what they are doing to us - as well as for us - since he wrote a chapter on the subject in his prize-winning essay, The Deepening Stream, published in 1940. 

The motoring revolution had not then begun the giant acceleration which has changed the world and all our lives. But changes and problems were beginning to show themselves. 

Holcroft now looks at New Zealand in what he sees as the climax of the motoring age. He studies its effects: the overbearing presence of vehicles, the economic consequences of universal car-ownership, the takeover of roads and land, the erosion of beaches and countryside, the loosening of family life and its social consequences, and changes in the New Zealand character. 

He writes as an essayist. His wider theme is life in New Zealand in the 20th century, and he brings to it the qualities of thought and style which have given him a separate and special place in New Zealand writing. The growth of motoring has been recorded by cameras, and full use was made of photographic archives to illustrate the text.

Born in 1946 in Kawakawa, Virginia King attended Wellington Polytechnic School of Design in 1963, Elam School of Fine Arts, University of Auckland in 1964/65 and Chelsea Art School, London in 1979. 

King is one of New Zealand's best known sculptors, she began focusing on sculpture in the mid-1980s, and has worked in Hinuera stone, bronze, aluminium, stainless steel, earth and wood. Underlying her practice is a concern for the environment, a passion for words and an interest in history and micro-organisms, all of which inspire and inform her work. King's sculptures have ranged from domestic scale to the monumental. King's public commissions include the Rewarewa Creek footbridge in Waitakere City, the Tree of Life sculpture at Auckland's AUT foyer, Nikau Vessel (a 5.5m high aluminium/stainless steel sculpture) in Hastings CBD and Reed Vessel, a 6.5m x 18m stainless steel sculpture incorporating flowing water, mist and poetry, among recreated wetlands in the Melbourne Docklands. 

Collaborative works include the concept design of the Mission Bay footbridge, and the Waitakere City Aquatic Centre.

They strike without warning, they cannot be controlled, there is no escape. And New Zealand has suffered more than its fair share of major shakes, which have brought with them death, injury, fear and sometimes cripplingly expensive damage. 

Wellington in 1848 and 1855, the Wairarapa in 1942, Inangahua in 1968, Edgecumbe in 1987, Gisborne in 2007...We are continually reminded that we do indeed inhabit the 'shaky isles', and that another big earthquake, probably on the Alpine Fault, is still a strong possibility. Growing up in Christchurch, author Anna Rogers had little experience of earthquakes.

 Later, when she lived for a dozen years in Wellington, the ground shook occasionally to remind everyone of the capital's position on New Zealand's main fault line.

 But nothing could have prepared her, or anyone else, for the 7.1 earthquake that struck Canterbury in the pre-dawn darkness of 4 September 2010, destroying many heritage buildings and homes, and its fatal successor, on 22 February 2011, which took the lives of 185 people and almost annihilated the Christchurch CBD.

This 3 DVD set has over 6 hours and has it all, right from the band’s beginnings. Gene Simmons, in full costume, declaring himself ""evil incarnate"" on The Mike Douglas Show; Margaret Hamilton, done up in her Wizard of Oz Wicked Witch Of The West garb, introducing KISS to the ever-cackling Paul Lynde on Lynde's 1976 Halloween special and the truly surreal incident where KISS went to Cadillac, Michigan, and had breakfast with the entire city council wearing full KISS makeup before the band made a spectacular exit by helicopter.

Rock & roll is full of strange phenomena, but KISS is one of the most inexplicable

An adolescent fever dream of superheroic hedonism that achieved world-wide stardom, and has entertained for over 30 years

Kissology is the ultimate visual Kiss collection. Presented in chronological order it combines never before seen footage, full length concerts and rare TV appearances from the Kiss archives

Volume 1 covers the band’s early years from 1974 to 1977 and is superbly packaged in a slipcased 3 DVD set, featuring material (aside form that mentioned above) that includes: Shows from Long Beach, CA (Feb 1974), San Francisco, CA (Jan 1975), Budokan, Japan (April 1977) and much more, featured tracks incl. ’Strutter’, ’Firehouse’, ’Black Diamond’, ’Cold Gin’, ’Rock & Roll All Nite’, ’God Of Thunder’, ’Love Gun’, ’Detroit Rock City’ and many more. The 3rd disc is housed in a card sleeve in the package, and is a complete gig from the Capitol Centre in Largo, Maryland (20/12/77). Bonus feature commentary by Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley on selected sections. The set is completed by a lavishly illustrated 20 page booklet featuring notes on the performances from Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and Ace Frehley

True to the colorful variety of his names, he has pursued many activities as a painter, architect, and ecologist, and as ""one who awakens identities.""This presentation of Hundertwassers work in all of its different facets is guided by the artist s own view of himself and his purpose. 

And, because his work is, by nature, virtually inseparable from his biography, his artistic and political actions, and equally so from the ""stories"" of his (ostensibly) private life, a vivid portrait of the artist takes shape before the readers eyes.

 Excerpts from conversations between the author and the artist lend a sense of immediacy and authenticity to the narration.

First edition 1963 

""The inspirational story of New Zealand athletics legend Murray Halberg - star product of the Lydiard technique of stamina training - who had no downhill run to his successes. At 17, a football injury nearly killed him. He had to fight to find within himself the mental toughness that wins great races. 
Murray became the first Kiwi sub-four minute miler, and his book will make you laugh, it will make your breathless with track-fever, and it will make you marvel at the sheer toughness of middle-distance racing.""

""A rugby player in his youth, Halberg suffered a severe injury during a game, leaving his upper left side crippled. The next year he took up running, only more motivated by his handicap.
Three years later, he broke through, winning his first national senior title and being allowed to compete in the 1954 Empire and Commonwealth Games - placing 5th in the mile. 

In 1958, Halberg became NZ Sportsman of the Year for becoming the first four minute miler from New Zealand and his gold medal in the 3 miles at the 1958 Commonwealth Games. For the 1960 Rome Olympics, Halberg focussed on longer distances, entering in the 5000 and 10000m. On the same day countryman Peter Snell was victorious in the 800m, Halberg grabbed the 5000m gold.

The nest year Halberg set four new world records. Carrying the flag at the opening ceremonies, Halberg successfully defended his 3 mile title at the 1962 Games. He closed out his running career at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo.

In 1963 Murray set up The Halberg Trust, which supports children with disabilities, and he became manager of the NZ Sportsman of the Year Award, which was later renamed the Halberg Award.""

It describes in fascinating detail what it is like to serve and sacrifice for your country, and the physical and mental discipline needed to go from peaceful New Zealand to a war-torn country where you are never sure who is your friend and who your enemy.


This is the story of Major Craig Wilson, combat leader, and the men and women of Bravo and Kiwi Companies. It starts in 2010 at Burnham army base and includes infantry preparations for their tour to Afghanistan, known as Crib 20 – the NZ Army’s deadliest tour of duty since Vietnam. In 2012, the story moves to Romero Base, Bamiyan Province, Afghanistan, as the security situation worsens and culminates in the battle at Baghek and its aftermath.


Major Craig Wilson is a decorated former SAS member. 

He was the commanding officer of Bravo Company, which lost 2 soldiers when they went to the aid Afghan police at Baghek in August 2012.

 Craig was left injured, shot in the shoulder, and was Medevac’d to a German hospital. There he heard 3 more of his team had died in an explosion.

Over 50 photographs, many never before published, including those from the day of the battle itself.

Central Otago, with its dramatic landscape and its climate extremes, provides a setting well suited to the story of human endeavour that preceded, and followed upon, the discovery of gold in its mountains, rivers and river terraces.

Before the gold miners came the explorers, men who performed prodigious physical feats, some in search of country for sheep and cattle, some for the joy of discovery itself. 

The Shotover, Skippers, Fox's secret valley, the Cardrona - these are the names to fire imagination of those who set out to travel the trails of the early gold seekers.

'Golden Days of Lake Country'. first issued in 1949, was one of the outstanding regional histories in the series published by the Otago Centennial Historical Committee.

THE WANGANUI STORY  Here is the story of a fascinating  New Zealand city. Long before the  white man arrived in the Wanganui  area, it was much desired and fought  over by warring Maori tribes.  The ?rst European sailed into the  Wanganui River on January 14, 1831

 He came to barter for supplies of  smoke-dried human heads which were  a specialty of the: area-— but ended up  as one of those objects he had come to  buy
  But settlers still came. Ten years  later, 40,000 acres of the best land  were purchased from the Maoris for a  miscellaneous collection of muskets,  hatchets, blankets, red night caps, looking glasses, pipes, beads, etc.  Still more white settlers arrived

 Ill  feeling grew when the Maori saw his tribal lands being taken from him. This  soon developed into open warfare as the  two cultures clashed. 

 In the pages of this book you can  follow the story of Wanganui and its  river, from the earliest Maori traditions  right through to the present day. The  main object has been to produce an  up-to-date and readable story for the  person who wants to know more about  historic Wanganui. The emphasis all  the way through the book has been on  a general social history rather than a  chronological listing of facts and dates.  It is a human story, adventurous,  often enthralling, at times amusing,  sometimes sad, but always most  readable.        
Wanganui is the city at the entrance to what is probably of NZ's most famous river, of the same name. 

The authors have collaborated to produce a valued history extending back to the arrival of the Maori, according to legend in 950AD, to their own later times, often troubled by inter-tribal conflict, early contacts with European navigators and explorers, although it was not until the 1830s the first sailed into the river seeking trade.",FALSE,,TRUE,30.00,30.00,45.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,5 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;14.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;0.0=Pick up No Cost;1.0=Postage after paying full post on the first item;2.0=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2023-08-20 10.38.33.jpg;2023-08-20 10.38.45.jpg;2023-08-20 10.38.54.jpg;2023-08-20 10.39.11.jpg;2023-08-20 10.39.14.jpg;2023-08-20 10.38.57.jpg;2023-08-20 10.39.19.jpg;2023-08-20 10.39.03.jpg;2023-08-20 10.39.23.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"week 23",FALSE,FALSE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

Raymond Harris-Ching paints wild creatures obsessively and has pushed the boundaries of bird painting from its familiar traditions to break entirely new ground. In ""Wild Portraits"" the distinctive Harris-Ching touch is seen over a range of wild portraits which for the first time cover his restless wanderings from the Arctic to Australasia. 

As well as works shown in their final painted form, many sheets of preparatory pencil sketches are included. In the book Raymond Harris-Ching's curiosity covers animals often ignored by painters (monkeys, porcupines, platypuses, lizards)

The most powerful of imperatives [is] the built-it animal desire to survive.

 The best and bravest of soldiers will eventually break down or runaway under stress, and he has no more choice in the matter than a starving man who steals a crust

This was not understood or anticipated when thousands of New Zealanders sailed off to the Great War -  Instead of adventure they found soldiering to be the tedium of the ship's voyage and the monotony of training. There was no glory in war, only the appalling conditions of trench warfare on the Western Front from which there was no escape. 

Many could not cope with these horrors and became disciplinary cases. 

There was little compassion for the misfit, the conscientious objector or those suffering from shell-shock and battle fatigue. There were court-martialled and received sentences ranging from the humiliation of field punishment to imprisonment or death by firing squad. 

The New Zealand Division became known as one of the finest serving in France, but part of the price paid for its high standard of discipline was the execution of its own men.

 In this book, acclaimed military historian Christopher Pugsley builds up a detailed picture of the circumstances that led to their deaths.

 ON THE FRINGE OF HELL will be an eyeopener to most New Zealanders, who until now were unaware of the sacrifices their forbears thought it necessary to make for the honour of their country.

Revealed are the very real and engaging experiences of Generals MacArthur and Blamey and other senior Australian commanders who sacrificed many of their senior field officers as scapegoats to protect their own positions, assisted in the making of false legends, and lied about the outcome of the men who fought the battles.

Jane Wordsworth has compiled biographies of 44 notable women of the Far North of NZ from the earliest time of European settlement until recent years. 

With the North being the cradle of NZ Europeanisation many of the pioneer woman of NZ were resident there, others were of more recent immigration, while others are members of the original residents, the Maori. 

The biographies embrace people from all walks of life, from different generations but all with some contribution to make to life , whether pioneers or later arrivals.

Preface.  This little book is a reprint, with some necessary modifications, of the articles which have appeared since july, 1935,. in the ""New Zealand Herald "" ""The Dominion,"" ""The Press, and the “Otago Daily Times,  under the title, ""Our Mother Tongue"" My thanks and acknowledgments are due to the editors and proprietors of these journals for their kind permission to reprint them in this form. The material has been re-arranged alphabetically for convenience of reference. The notes on surnames have been excluded, chiefly because they are often not of much interest to those who do not happen to bear the names discussed. The notes on pronuncia- tion suffer grievously, but unavoidably, for the want of phonetic symbols, and l must apologise for the idiotic appearance of many of the renderings given I am sorry for my readers if the sight of them hurts them as much as the writing hurts me. It may be noticed that in dealing with questions of pronuncia- tion l avoid the term ""accent,” and always use ""stress.” This is because “accent” may mean so many other things—at least three other things-— whereas ""stress,” in pronunciation, has only the sense · in which I use it, that is ""emphasis.”

Plastic surgery was in its infancy before the Second World War ? the most rudimentary techniques were known only to a few surgeons worldwide. 

The Allies were tremendously fortunate in having the maverick surgeon Archibald McIndoe operating at a small hospital in East Grinstead in the south of England. After arguing with his superiors, McIndoe set up a revolutionary new treatment regime and rightly secured his group of patients, dubbed the Guinea Pig Club, and honoured place in society.

 Based on extensive research into official records and moving first-person recollections, this extraordinary book brings home the heroism and triumphs of this courageous band of men and contains updated material on how their example is inspiring today’s wounded veterans.

Wilderness in New Zealand is becoming increasingly rare. In an age when you can be almost anywhere in the bush by helicopter in a matter of minutes (rather than days on foot) finding a true wilderness experience is something of a challenge, and when you get there the presence of barley sugar wrappers would indicate someone else has been there before you. 

If you eschew the helicopter and walk to your intended hunting area the remoteness and isolation become more tangible and more of a true wilderness experience. ""This is real deer country, right from the start of the bush edge. The walk is soft, the direction is constant, and you are just looking and tuning in to being in the bush and carrying a rifle.

 The roar is here, and anything can happen.

The new arrivals were servicemen returning from the war who had been balloted to recently subdivided farming units. These units had been created from the large pastoral runs which had dominated the basin from the 1850s. 

The new families faced many years of struggle as they sought to tame the elements, settle their homes and establish their farming careers. In the face of adversity a resourceful, strong kindred spirit developed forging many lifelong friendships. 

These are previously unpublished intergenerational stories from soldier settlers and current and former owners, managers and staff of Mt. Algius, Glenthorne, Acheron Bank, Lake Coleridge, High Peak, Snowdon, The Point Stations and the 20 properties that were split from them. From Mount Algidus to the Rakaia Gorge this is a comprehensive account of this well-known community as told by the people who have lived and worked in the area.

Great read

This was Philip Holden's sixth hunting book and includes his experiences in both Australia and NZ, with quarry ranging from deer to buffalo, wild pigs and few other species gone feral. Holden has a knack of injecting the tension of the hunt in his story-telling and it is this that made him one of NZ's most prolific and respected writers on the topic. His ""Seasons of a Hunter"" includes anecdotes and recollections about prized rifles.

"PR525","local history Early Pioneers Chinese Central Otago",1.0000,FALSE,1817,,"History Of Chinese Fruitshops In New Zealand Softcovered Vol 2 462 Pages",,"Long before supermarkets became a one-stop shop for fresh produce as they are today, local fruit and vegetable stores run by Chinese families were a pillar of our communities. This book chronicles the lives of these pioneering greengrocers and fruiterers as they carved their place into the countrys rich social and cultural tapestry. The personal anecdotes, historical documents and photos tell the stories of these families as they provided a vital service with a smile to their community and their journeys of growing up Kiwis. That includes the story of Colin Lowe of Norman Lowe Ltd in Whakatane: Being the son of a fruiterer meant you spent most of your spare time after school and in the weekends helping out. As a child I can still remember time spent unfolding unsold newspaper ready for wrapping veges in, unloading empty boxes and stacking them alongside the driveway ready for a carrier to collect them and take them to a market garden, sorting out the broken ones for repairing. These stories bring a unique perspective on New Zealands history as they trace the evolution of these shops from the general store-cum-greengrocery of the 1880s through to the fresh fruit and vegetable retailers we know today. It follows the fortunes and misfortunes of the Chinese in New Zealand through the hard times of the Depression and World War II, the growth and boom times of the 1950s and 60s and the challenge of supermarket giants eating up the competition.

Volume 2 (464 pages) presents stories from the Hawkes Bay region through to the Auckland region. The appendices include a list of all known Chinese fruit shops from the 1880s to the current day, and maps of the Guangdong counties the Chinese fruiterers originated from. Both volumes are fully-illustrated with photos, graphs and statistical tables.

The Fruits of Our Labours was written and researched by Ruth Lam, Beverly Lowe, Helen Wong, Michael Wong, and Carolyn King.

Wearing the colour red, living by the 'law of lawnessness' and having the patch with the emblem of the mighty bulldog on your back was what ex-Mongrel Mob leader Tuhoe 'Bruno' Isaac called being True Red. ""Because all levels of society hated us we created a new society of hatred symbolised by the bulldog. Its ferocious habits were engraved on our hearts,"" Tuhoe says, ""If you weren't a mobster you weren't worth knowing."" He lived this way for 17 years.

However, constantly living for the bash, beer, prison and the possibility of dying in a pool of blood eventually saw Tuhoe search for another way of doing life. Leaving the Mob was hard. Not only did he face the rejection of his own and the fierce judgemental prejudices of mainstream society, but with the awakening of his conscience came the realisation of a past filled with inflicting pain on others besides himself, and of a life devoid of any sense of love or hope. This led him down a path of confession, forgiveness and reconciliation.

Buried in doubt is a tale of poison and how it was allegedly used in two deaths by a married New Zealand woman, Jane Hampton/Smith/Baikie. 
In the early 1900’s Jane was charged with the murders of two male ‘friends’. 

 Both men’s bodies required exhumation after they were initially believed to be both natural deaths, and after testing were found to contain either arsenic or strychnine. The book describes Jane’s four trials and their outcomes in Sydney, Australia. 
It also examines the use of poison and the long-standing belief that it was a women’s weapon of choice for murder. It evaluates the findings of expert witnesses on poison, examines other New Zealand and Australian cases, and questions the level of awareness held by male juries about developments in medical jurisprudence, forensic science and toxicology.

It started with 167 primary school-age pupils (many of whom were illiterate) and one teacher, Janet Mackenzie. Mothers were enlisted to supervise their children’s school work. 

By 1927 the school had several teachers and a roll of 720. In 1928, secondary courses were offered for the first time.

Australian Pottery by Kenneth Hood and Wanda Garnsey. Photographs by Douglas Thompson. 'Since the last war and especially during the last few years, there has been a considerable awakening of interest in pottery. Most Australian technical schools have pottery classes and workshops and each year more exhibitions by established and professional potters are to be seen. This is the first substantial book which seriously considers the achievements of twenty of Australia's most influential and distinguished potters. The wide range of craftsmen chosen for inclusion in this book clearly demonstrates and explains the numerous directions in which Australian potters are working in the 1970s.' The book covers have medium rubbing and stains and the binding is becoming loose - but the book remains most readable.

From early European settlement in the 1830's to the present day, the book tells of the various owners and the differing uses of the land.

Waiaua to Kauri Cliffs"" is a lively, well-researched account of Tepene (previously known as Waiaua, a farm situated on the east coast of Northland between Whangaroa and the Bay of Islands) and the surrounding area

From the 1830s when the first European settlers arrived to the present day. It was a tough and lonely life for these pioneer families. Many of the men worked long and hard in the bush as well as clearing the land for building their homes and for farming. For the women it was perhaps even more difficult. With families to feed and care for, and little or no medical assistance to help with sickness and injury, they lived in primitive and harsh conditions.

 Running water was a luxury and there was the ever-present need to supplement the food supply. 

Throughout the early years there were also some tense moments as the settlers developed ongoing relationships with local Maori. However as the local people became more established they went on to start schools and set up other community amenities. Lorelei Hayes writes movingly of the struggles through the Depression years, the poverty experienced by those who were unemployed in the area, and the resourcefulness and skills needed to survive. 

She includes her own experience of farming at Tepene until it was sold, and concludes with the development of Kauri Cliffs, one of New Zealand's top golf courses and luxury lodges, which has been built on the property

The narrative of the Parihaka community sheds light on a critical period in Aotearoa’s colonial past. As the government seized their land, Maori communities across the region engaged in non-violent resistance, with Parihaka emerging as a powerful symbol of defiance under the leadership of Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kakahi.

Rather than a history of Parihaka itself, Hazel Riseborough’s compelling account delves into the government’s systematic efforts to dismantle Maori rights and self-determination. First published in 1989, Days of Darkness is published now in a new edition which includes opening words contributed by the Parihaka community.

Company of Heaven. Early Missionaries in the South Seas by Graeme Kent. 'They were dedicated people willing to face humiliation, injury, even death. Some were explorers, some were political manipulators, some were martyrs, some succumbed to the temptations of the 'paradise' that was the Pacific. But most of them were brave and sincere and did much to preserve some decency in the lawless South Seas, where European slave traders, sandalwood dealers and escaped convicts were cruelly changing the lives of the islanders. In this book are the stories of the missionaries' struggles in exotic places such as Fiji, Tahiti, Hawaii, Pitcairn, the Solomons, New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand'.

.Sir Edmund Hillary became famous by being the first, with Tenzing Norgay, to climb Mt Everest in 1953. Though this was clearly a remarkable feat, Sir Edmund came to be regarded by many as a great man for the way he chose to use his fame,  which was to dedicate much of the rest of his life to building schools and hospitals for the Sherpa people of Nepal.

Himalayan Hospitals tells the remarkable story of the two hospitals he built: Khunde Hospital in 1966 in the Khumbu region at the foot of Mt Everest, and Phaplu Hospital in 1975 in the Solu Valley. These hospitals were staffed by volunteer doctors and their partners from New Zealand and Canada until they were eventually handed over to Sherpa doctors.

Using letters written by these volunteers, and many subsequent interviews Michael Gill, a doctor himself who worked with Sir Edmund from the beginning on these projects, has pieced together this fascinating history of a unique aid project. It has many threads: an honest and fresh insight into the life of Sir Edmund Hillary, a rich and real picture of Sherpa culture, and the transformative experiences of the volunteers, whose lives were often completely changed by their time working in the Sherpa communities.

Moving, insightful and ultimately inspirational, Himalayan Hospitals is a wonderful book, that has at its heart the integrity and humility of Sir Edmund Hillary, one of New Zealand’s true heroes.

 Not surprisingly deer and deer hunting continued to play a major part in his life. 

Author of the highly successful books Murphy's Law and The Hunter, Murphy On My Back, How I Met Murphy, Murphy Strikes Back and Ranger Murphy. 

This book covers the latter years the author spent as a New Zealand Forest Service Ranger in North West Nelson, his interest in flying and how the arrival of the meat-hunters and their helicopter influenced his daily routine. 

Then a change to forestry and the stresses of the job relieved with family hunts - with Murphy always in close attendance.

 Told with humour and a deep affection for the people places and events he describes. This book is filled with a wide variety of stories from numerous hunting trips both on the job and off, as well as anecdotes from every day life as a forest ranger and forestry officer. Inevitably Murphy has the last word.

The battles of the Ardennes campaign - The Battle of the Bulge - decided the war in western Europe, and in The Battle for the Rhine, Neillands tells us the large-scale story of how this fight altered the course of the war."" ""Who was really responsible for the failure at Nijmegen, the destruction of the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem and the failure of Operation Market Garden? Why was Montgomery threatened with the sack when he had just retrieved Bradley's failure in the Battle of the Bulge? Was General Eisenhower's command strategy either workable or wise, and did Bradley and Patton undermine it? 


Even after sixty years, the questions remain. With superb battle narratives, and clear analysis of success and failure at every point, Neillands casts a new and informed light on the costly struggle for the Rhine--the gateway to the heart of Europe. Would this be the beginning of the end? It didnot seem so. In The Battle for the Rhine, Robin Neillands has pulled off a triumph of military and political narrative.""--Jacket.

The Irish Guards in the Great War - Edited and Compiled from Their Diaries and Papers

Volume I  The First Battalion

1997 Excellent condition

This historical work by the great Kipling has all but been forgotten.

 As the title indicates, it covers the actions of the Irish Guards' First Battalion in World War I. Although Kipling was always a friend to the soldier, this book had special meaning to him since his son fought with and was killed in the unit.

 A towering piece of regimental history by one of our greatest writers.

Review

Rudyard Kipling's 18-year-old son was killed in battle while serving with the Irish Guards in World War I. When, soon after the war, the Guards' commander asked if the great man would care to write a regimental history of the Guards, Kipling dropped everything and spent the next five years creating one of the world's most remarkable works of military history literature. The Irish Guards In The Great War: The First Battalion has been out of print since 1923, Kipling's masterpiece is now lavishly republished by Sarpedon Publishers with never-before-seen illustrations from the Irish Guards' archives, plus their original maps. World War I is often viewed as a tragedy in history, but tragic too, is the fact that generations since have lost sight of the ""humanity"" of those millions of citizen-soldiers sucked into the violent maelstrom of the ""Grate War"". 

This last great work of Rudyard Kipling illuminates the struggles and travails of our grandfathers and great-grandfathers, immortalizing their experience for all readers of military history and of great literature",FALSE,,TRUE,18.00,18.00,,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Shipping  ....

New Zealand Car Production 1921-98 By Mark Webster

New Zealand's car assembly industry began with the Colonial Motor Company piecing together Ford Model T's in the early 1920s, and the first true production line came in 1926 with General Motors. 

For the next 70 years, as governments imposed tariffs on importing completely built up cars, the assembly industry directly employed thousands of New Zealanders, and indirectly supported tens of thousands more.  

 Factories assembling models from the Morris Minor to the Toyota Hilux became part of the social fabric of communities up and down the country. 

Car assembly provided employment, helped in the Second World War effort, fostered a local supply industry, and even gave opportunities for New Zealand to export cars. But the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s dealt blow after blow to the industry, and the removal of import tariffs on cars in 1998 was the death knell.
 
Before records disappeared and key figures moved on, Mark Webster scoured the country interviewing, delving into company archives and photographing.

Assembly: New Zealand Car Production 1921-98 is his loving record of an industry that is gone but not forgotten.

Report on Experience is a compelling memoir written by a quietly heroic author. 

This brilliantly written work provides insight both into the mind of the author and the prevailing attitudes of wartime Britain and Europe. Mulgan traces the Allies' path to World War II and the widespread reluctance of the population to accept the reality of hostilities. 

A determined man, he was appalled first by the inaction of his peers and superiors, then by the weak and unrealistic reactions to aggression.

In September, 1944, in Arnhem, Holland, what was to have been a brilliant battle-a battle meant to hasten an end to the war-instead turned into an epic tragedy.

 Nine-thousand men of the First British Airborne division parachuted into the countryside, behind German lines, with a mission: to capture and hold the bridge over the Rhine ahead of the advancing British Second Army.

 But the result was disastrous: the men faced constant bombardment. Nine days later, after some of the fiercest street fighting of the war, only 2,000 of the paratroopers managed to escape to safety.

Nearly a century has passed since the outbreak of World War I, yet as military historian Hew Strachan (winner of the 2016 Pritzker Literature Award) argues in this brilliant and authoritative new book, the legacy of the “war to end all wars” is with us still. The First World War was a truly global conflict from the start, with many of the most decisive battles fought in or directly affecting the Balkans, Africa, and the Ottoman Empire. Even more than World War II, the First World War continues to shape the politics and international relations of our world, especially in hot spots like the Middle East and the Balkans.

Strachan has done a masterful job of reexamining the causes, the major campaigns, and the consequences of the First World War, compressing a lifetime of knowledge into a single definitive volume tailored for the general reader. Written in crisp, compelling prose and enlivened with extraordinarily vivid photographs and detailed maps, The First World War re-creates this world-altering conflict both on and off the battlefield—the clash of ideologies between the colonial powers at the center of the war, the social and economic unrest that swept Europe both before and after, the military strategies employed with stunning success and tragic failure in the various theaters of war, the terms of peace and why it didn’t last.

Drawing on material culled from many countries, Strachan offers a fresh, clear-sighted perspective on how the war not only redrew the map of the world but also set in motion the most dangerous conflicts of today. Deeply learned, powerfully written, and soon to be released with a new introduction that commemorates the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the war, The First World War remains a landmark of contemporary history.

Chichi Jima is an obscure island north west of Iwo Jima. During WWII it was the site of powerful radio transmitters which enabled communications with far flung Japanese outposts in the Pacific.

 It was in the interests of the US military to silence them hence a series of attacks by US Naval aviators in 1945. This is the same battle that the late George Bush Sr. participated in and was shot down with the loss of his two man crew. As such are the fortunes of war: Ensign Bush bailed out of a burning plane, alighted in the water and a submarine surfaced to rescue him, someone else bailed out of another plane, fell into the hands of the Japanese and disappeared. 

  A number of planes were shot down, with numerous fatalities and several Americans falling into the hands of the Japanese.

Imagined by an aristocrat in White's Club, London in 1925, a part-time squadron of wealthy young men with their own private aircraft was incorporated into a newly-established combat-ready Auxiliary Air Force, first as bombers, then fighters. 

The pre-war years combined serious training with frivolity and mischief, but the outbreak of war in 1939 changed that. Despite their social rank the pilots were thrust into the heart of the action, with mortality proving to be the great social leveler. From privileged pre-war lifestyles to front line deployment the lives of those who survived underwent radical change. 

Through the battles of Britain, Malta, the African desert and Italy the squadron's composition was transformed, and by war's end only a minority were British and none were millionaires. Britain had changed too, and the re-formed squadron filled with a combination of veterans and young middle-class ex-service pilots. 

The pilots flew Hurricanes in the Battle of Britain, and Spitfires thereafter until the arrival of jets in the '50s; DH Vampires and Gloster Meteors. The one aircraft they could not master was the little-loved mid-engine P-39 Bell Airacobra in 1941. Disbandment in 1957 of the by-then 'Royal' Auxiliary Air Force was fiercely resisted, but inevitable

 War, it has been said is 99% boredom and 1% intense activity. As we discover in this book, war is also about humour, tragedy and intense personal experiences. So often, books about war are written from the point of view of the Generals or the Admirals or by historians trying to set the record straight as they see it. Only in recent years, has it become fashionable to give the non-commissioned officer's version of modern war. As the world contemplates a new theatre of war in Europe, Fred's personal insights provide a telling reminder that, ultimately, war is about people killing people 

Born in London in 1912, Fred worked as a messenger before joining H.M. Royal Marines at age 17 without telling his parents. The next 21 years saw him serving in the peacetime navy and during World War II on board ships in the North Sea, the Fiords of Norway, the Mediterranean and Crete, the United States and with the 42 Commando in Malta and Egypt and later the Palestine. In 1951, Fred and his family arrived in New Zealand as new immigrants in the post—war period.

For the last thousand years or so innovation, prosperity, conflict, challenge HY and change have crashed relentlessly against New Zealand's coasts. They are our front door. Research has killed the myth of the Polynesian Great Fleet' but many fleets have surged past since-fleets of crusading colonists, fleets of 'Home' boats, the American 'Great White Fleet', the container and bulk carrier fleets of the 1970s and the Bolly-swilling America's Cup flotillas. All have left their mark.'

So begins Gavin McLean's extraordinary chronicle of the tempestuous history of New Zealand's coastline.

Published in conjunction with a four-part television programme, Captain's Log takes us from the arrival of the first waka to the wakes of the superyachts via assisted migration, the Union Steam Ship Company, the wars and the container ships.

Along the way, Captain's Log reminds us of the deep affinity New Zealanders have for their coastline and the sea.

Introduction

This book has been written to coincide with the celebrations of the Hukerenul School Centenary 1889-1989. It covers the early history of Hukerenui, with a brief look at the close settlements; Puhipuhi, Taheroa, Tapuhi, and Whakapara. As books on both Riponui and Jordan have previously been published, I only included the history of their schools.

Originally known as Hukerenui South, the area was opened up for settlement in 1887, although many of the pioneers were in the district as early as 1881. The young men came ahead. They walked for miles, cutting their path through the bush, chose their land and went back to the land office to claim it. Some went off to earn the money they needed to pay for the surveyors fees; others returned with their families...... This was the beginning.


For many years these small districts flourished but inevitably the effects of the two world wars and the depression were felt. Jordan was the first of the district schools to consolidate with Hukerenui in 1938, then came Riponui Pah in 1945. Two years later it was followed by Tapuhi, and in May 1948, Riponui Valley.

 In the centenary celebrations of his university in 1969, Morrell received an honorary LittD. In 1973 he was honoured with a festschrift, and in 1978 was made a CBE. Judicious of judgement, meticulous in scholarship, showing a mastery of a range of documents, Morrell's works have not been superseded. 

He provided the best accounts available of British policies towards New Zealand in the mid nineteenth century. The provincial system was a pioneering work, never matched.

For three years from 1940 the Second New Zealand Division, led by Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg, fought in the North African desert against a combined German-Italian army and its formidable leader, Field-Marshal Erwin Rommel.
Rommel regarded the Kiwis as the elite of the British army, and their General was officially classified as a ‘dangerous opponent.’ During the desperate months of mid-1942, the New Zealand Division was almost all that stood between Rommel and Egypt.
It was a hard-fought campaign. Yet the North African campaign was also a human story. Ordinary New Zealanders from civilian walks of life — accountants, lawyers, plumbers, labourers, teachers, musicians, even politicians — found unexpected strength within themselves to meet the demands of the war.
Their battlegrounds — Sidi Rezegh, Ruweisat Ridge, Mingar Qaim, El Alamein, Tebaga Gap and Takrouna — are also part of New Zealand’s history.

‘In the battle which is sure to come within a few days, [the] outcome depends almost entirely upon Freyburg’s [sic] division and air support. New Zealand Division is by far the best fighting unit in the Middle East. Freyburg [sic] is a very great leader of men, possessed of tremendous courage and sound judgement.’
- US Army Forces in Middle East, official report, 27 June 1942

The New Zealanders...are trained and led by General Freyberg, a dangerous opponent. They are specialists in night fighting, they fight on a wide front, and...have learnt to follow up closely under the heavy artillery barrages which they use...They are also capable, in difficult country, of fighting without tank support...
- German staff assessment of 2 NZ Division

Bob ""Roberto"" Rogers, was harboured by Vignoni's late great-grandparents, Giuseppe and Iolanda Manessi, in the Italian village of Gaina for more than six months during World War II.


Rogers served in North Africa with the British Army but was captured by the Germans when his position was over-run by tanks.

He was one of 3000 Allied prisoners-of-war bound for Italy aboard the cargo ship MV Nino Bixio when it was torpedoed twice by a Royal Navy submarine.

Although the number of casualties was high, the ship didn't sink and survivors were moved to Italian prisoner-of-war camps.

 Rogers was sent to PG 70 in Monturano.

Eventually Rogers escaped north to the small village of Gaina, near Brescia, the German headquarters for Italy during the war, and close to the Swiss border.

He was ""adopted"" by the Manessi family who risked their own lives to hide Rogers. They made him one of their own, dressing him in civvies and teaching him Italian.

He eventually reached freedom in Switzerland, later returning to his home town of Tyneside in north-east England and moving to New Zealand in 1958, settling in Palmerston North.

Rogers who died in 2010, aged 89 penned an autobiography called Sixty bonus years; a tale of survival

""In the late nineteenth century a remote southern bay on the west coast of New Zealand was being heralded as the natural port for the Australian trade for the whole of the South Island, and the site of a future metropolis. The idea came to nothing, the settlement was abandoned and the land reverted to wilderness, but the area remains, in history and landscape, one of the most fascinating in New Zealand. Philip Houghton tells of both - of the explorers who came and viewed the land and wrote of it with optimism, or pessimism; and of mountain, bush, lake and sea as he has come to know them, and of the wildlife he has observed""

Today accessed from Queenstown via the same road that leads to the Coronet Peak skifield, Skippers Canyon is carved out by the Shotover River. 

The Shotover, one of New Zealand's richest gold-bearing rivers, was named by William Gilbert Rees who with his wife Frances and brother-in-law Nicholas von Tunzelmann were the first European settlers in and near where Queenstown is now.

Once a busy goldmining area, Skippers Canyon was accessed by Skippers Road, which is today one of New Zealand's better known scenic roads. 

The main New Zealand road where rental car insurance is not honoured, Skippers Road is mostly one-lane, narrow and steep with sheer drops of several hundred metres. 

In 1886, European settlers was also the first site where hydroelectricity was generated to power goldmining

The 1840 Treaty of Waitangi was a pivotal event in New Zealand history. It provided the foundation for British sovereignty and, though downplayed through much of the subsequent century and a half, has had its status as a source of law reinforced in recent years by the operation of the Waitangi Tribunal.Claudia Orange's remarkable history was first published in 1987. 

Winning the Goodman Fielder Wattie Award, it went on to sell over 40,000 copies. Much that the book said was new to Pakeha - and even more surprising was the force with which Maoridom welcomed (and drove forward) the government's initiatives - particularly the newly formed Waitangi Tribunal. Today the Treaty has come to signify what both joins and divides the people of this country. It had different meanings also to those present at the 1840 signing - the new arrivals and the tangata Whenua then occupying the land. To the British, it was the means by which they gained sovereignty over the country; for Maori, it represented something closer to partnership.

 That these distinct meanings were conveyed in texts written in different languages only added to the complexities now woven around this crucial agreement. The Treaty of Waitangi is a comprehensive study, looking at the place of the Treaty in New Zealand history from its making in the early nineteenth century through to the renewed engagement of the late twentieth century.

Thousands of young single women came to New Zealand between the 1840s and 1880s as `government'  or assisted immigrants. In this remarkable study Charlotte Macdonald explores their life histories and patterns both prior to and after emigration and in so doing challenges many of our preconceptions about women's lives in nineteenth-century New Zealand.

Many books have been written by officers, historians and military experts on the part the Anzacs played in the Dardanelles campaign during the First World War. There are very few by the ordinary soldier. Roy Kyle started writing this memoir at the age of 89 and almost completed it before he died. A typical Anzac, fiercely patriotic, he enlisted in the A.I.F. in 1915, several months under-age. 

He spent his eighteenth birthday in the terrible trenches of Gallipoli and then went on to serve on the Western Front. An Anzac's Story is an honest, poignant account of a young man's experience of war. It is much more than this, though, for Roy Kyle's story begins with his colourful, classic Australian childhood in country New South Wales and Victoria in the early years of last century. Bryce Courtenay, who helped get Roy Kyle's memoirs published, has provided a moving introduction to his life and times.

The story of the trading scow from its earliest day to its zenith of usefulness and its gradual decline is of peculiar interest to New Zealanders. As Mr. P. A. Eaddy explains so fully in this quite fascinating sea-book, the scow type of vessel was a factor of the first importance in the development of the northern parts of the Dominion. 

The history of this evolution of vessels and men to fit the needs of a pioneering stage in North New Zealand life has not until now been told in satisfying detail. One or two of our veteran sailors have given us capital short stories of the scows; but it remained for the author of this book to narrate the rise and glory of the type of working craft that served New Zealand so well in a now all but vanished period.

In this collection of exhilarating and page-turning stories, Chris Bonington looks at the adventurous impulse which has driven men and women to achieve the impossible in all the earth's elements - crossing its oceans, deserts and poles, canoeing its rivers, climbing its mountains, in balloons above and in caves beneath its surface. He has travelled extensively to talk to the adventurers whose stories are told in this book. He examines the motives and dedication, the mounting of each expedition, the perils and rigours encountered, the moments of exhilaration and sometimes tragedy involved in these achievements. This unique book brings together the greatest moments in adventure and exploration in the second half of this century.

Scales Corporation was founded by George Herbert Scales and is one of New Zealand's oldest companies having operated since 1897. It began life as a protest movement when a group pf central New Zealand sheep farmers formed a Freight Reduction Committee to challenge the freight rates being charged by the large British shipping lines. When their agreement with a Dunedin firm collapsed, Walter Buchanan, Hugh Williams and their supporters sought help from George Scales.

Geo.H.Scales sympathised with them. As an auctioneer, insurance broker and Secretary to the Wellington Agricultural and Pastoral Association, he knew the concerms of the farmers of the region. Soon he was chartering sailing ships for the Freight Reduction Committee against fierce competition from the established Lines. In 1912 the venture became a private company with its unusual articles of association confining shareholdings to sheep farmers (Geo.H.Scales being the sole exception).

Scales ran his company on a shoestring. He did most of the travelling himself, loading the ships with all the wool the shareholders could provide, filling any empty space with wool from outside sources, or timber, coal, grain or feed shipped on his own account.

After Geo.H.Scales died in 1928 the company bearing his name and his private company Geo.H.Scales Pacific, continued to share modest offices in Wellington ‘Scales' chartered three wool ships a year while ‘Pacific' handled insurance, coal agency and stevedoring work.

In this absorbing book, ten New Zealand women look back on their lives throughout the twentieth century. They share memories of their families and themselves: 

Enid hides naked in the broom cupboard to avoid the mter reader; during 1942 Wellington earthquake Shirley runs through the heaving night-time streets to find a doctor; Oho helps restore a special house on the marae dedicated to her ancestor, Hinepare, and remembers the news of her father's death during the war; and Janne discovers the mysteries of the bovine digestive system when a calf swallows her raincoat belt.
Poignant, funny and highly readable, this collection includes stories and anecdotes about marriage, childhood, families, holidays, first loves, travel and newfound independence. The ten writers, who met through a summer writing course, are from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, and include Maori and immigrant women. Their experiences reflect those of a large number of New Zealands, who will recognise with delight many of the events in these pages.

In the autumn of 1978 the media in Australia and New Zealand ran a hot story on how the author, winner of the 1974 Transtasman singlehanded race, New Plymouth to Mooloolaba, Queensland, had started the 1978 race but had gone missing. 

The nub of the story was the apparent reluctance of the race's organisers to instigate a search. 

The eventual air search located Bill's 'Josephine II' on the notorious Middleton Reef, but 'HMAS Swan' could find no trace of Bill and the liferaft. The story culminated when, after 28 days of drifting in a raft, Bill was picked up by a Nauru-bound ship.

 The book opens with a short description of Bill's adventures before coming to New Zealand then switches to the 1974 race and the building of 'Jo' for the 1978 event. The chapters then alternate between Bill at sea, and Aileen waiting in a growing agony of anxiety and frustratration at Mooloolaba - an anxiety only fractionally alleviated by the news of 'Jo' being found, deserted, on the reef

Setting off for a ‘great adventure’, New Zealand soldiers in the First World War found themselves in the midst of tragedy. The diaries and letters they wrote home vividly describe their experiences and feelings. 
These writings form an historical account of the Great War, but they are also highly individual stories of eight men whose lives change dramatically as they write. The reader is caught up in their hopes, loves and ambitions as they try to maintain their humanity amidst the flies and heat of Gallipoli, or the mud and slaughter of Flanders. 
Jock Phillips and Nicholas Boyack have researched widely to compile this book, which is illustrated with superb photographs fromsoldiers’ albums. E. P. Malone has edited the diary of his grandfather, Colonel W. G. Malone, who died at Chunuk Bair.

In the winter of 1840, recent immigrant John Logan Campbell and his business partner William Brown settled on an island at the mouth of the Waitematā Harbour, confident that the Tāmaki Peninsula would soon house the colony’s capital. By the time the capital shifted south the following year, Campbell was poised to make a tremendous profit from – and contribution to – the growth of the town. He became known as the Father of Auckland.

From a warehouse in Shortland Crescent, Campbell and his partner conducted their business as general merchants (with Māori trade particularly profitable), auctioneers, shipping and commission agents, and land speculators. The speculative coup of this period was the purchase in September 1853 of a superb 1000-acre [405-ha] suburban farm, which Campbell renamed One Tree Hill. Much against his inclinations he became caught up in politics, serving as provincial superintendent and as a member of the House of Representatives for the City of Auckland in 1855–56.

In the late 19th century, Campbell expanded his commercial empire into timber milling and breweries, founded Auckland’s first school of art, and served on more than 40 committees, boards, trusts or directorates. No ceremonial occasion in Auckland was complete without his presence. In 1901, at the age of 83, Campbell was persuaded to serve as honorary mayor of Auckland to welcome the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and of York to New Zealand

An Atomic Odyssey in Australia's Wild West, and Things Seen and Heard by the Way in a Jeep Jaunt.
Frank Clune decides to join the (1950s) uranium rush in Australia's Northern Territory, leaving Sydney in a Jeep, with a geologist and geiger counter.

 While the geologist prospected, Clune met and talked with many 'characters' along the way. Did they find uranium? Yes, but someone found it before them - but they pegged a lease anyway.

No Place to Linger"" is the story of a New Zealand naval reserve officer serving on, and commanding, Corvettes in the Battle of the Atlantic. It is very much a personal history, and a very well-written one at that.

 Written and published in the mid-1980s, many years after the events took place, based on his diaries from the time as well as naval records. The author was 28 years old in 1940 when he left behind his fiancee of two weeks and sailed for the UK to join the Royal Navy.

 He served as First Lieutenant on the Flower Class Corvette HMS Lavender, based out of Freetown, in West Africa (the convoy capital of the South Atlantic). In January 1942 he became Commanding Officer of HMS Crocus, the ship that later played the part of HMS Compass Rose in the film of Nicholas Monsarrats famous novel, The Cruel Sea (Classics of War).

 He saw a great deal of action in Crocus until their ways parted in July 1943. Especially memorable were the rescue of the survivors from the sinking of the Empress of Canada and the sad saga of Convoy SL 125, where sixteen ships and nearly 1,000 lives were lost.

One of the highlights of the book is the night in October 1942 when Crocus and U-boat 333 battled for survival off Freetown

Did Mallory and Irvine reach Everest's summit 30 years before Hillary and Tenzing? Until now, clues about what happened to these two Everest pioneers had been scant and misleading. Until now, no one has known whether they reached the summit. Until now, no one has known where or how they perished.

This is a detective story of the first order. It is the story not just of Mallory and Irvine's last climb, but of the team of climbers and researchers who, together, found the body of perhaps Britain's greatest mountaineer and uncovered the startling story he had waited so long to reveal. Written by the three key members of the team, and incorporating extensive interviews with other team members, GHOSTS OF EVEREST is the dramatic unfolding of both the 1999 and 1924 expeditions, woven together into a compelling narrative.

Geoffrey Ellis joined the RAF as a Cranwell apprentice in 1923. As a boy entrant he was one of the first of Lord Trenchards highly qualified aircraft tradesmen  and after a few years in the service was posted to the Sudan and his experiences there make fascinating reading.

 He became a member of the New Zealand Permanent Air Force in 1933 (the RNZAF was established in 1938) and his recollections of the PAF, a very small force, and the rapid development of the RNZAF up to WWII are also revealing. He played an important role in the force during WWII, retiring after 25 years service with the RNZAF with the rank of Wing Commander.

New Zealand University Press for the Lower Hutt City Corporation Wellington, N.Z.

1972.

David Millar traces the main developments of a NZ city with clarity. Politics, religion, geography, economics and social history all have their place. He aids the reader by placing this outline in a context of developments elsewhere within the country. He does so in an easily read manner, and lights it all in gentle humour. His research has unearthed stories full of human interest, some surprising, others disturbing ? all of importance.

Once Upon a Village is very readable. The author avoids long lists of forgotten names or defunct organizations.

 He has chosen photos to illustrate specific events within the text, and provides clear maps for the enquirer. 

There is an ample appendix of reference material for the more specific reader.

Tony Ratcliffe is the man behind New Zealand's iconic circus, The Whirling Bros Circus. 

Many New Zealanders experienced the thrill of watching exotic animals and circus performers under his Big Top during the last 20th Century. An integral part of that show was Jumbo the Elephant, another New Zealand icon that stole the hearts of us all.

This book tells of how Tony Ratcliffe created Whirling Bros and how he built it into New Zealand's biggest and longest-running national and international travelling show.

With a stunning array of pictures and photographs Tony brings his story to life - the grandeur, the daring, the skill and the scale of his enterprise.

A New Zealand Soldier at War 1917-1919

Boots, belts, rifle and pack.


Between July 1917 and February 1919, his boots, belts, rifle and pack came to play a very important role in the life of No. 61322 Pte William Malcolm as he found himself caught up in the momentum of war.

Born in 1897 at Enfield, North Otago, Bill Malcolm was the third son from his family to leave home to serve his country.

Soon after his arrival at Trentham Military Camp, he regularly wrote letters home, keeping his family informed on the day-to-day happenings of army life. These letters are published here for the first time.

In the 75 years since the letters were written, hundreds of books have been published on the subject of the 1914-1918 war, but Boots, Belts, Rifle and Pack is different. It brings to life the more personal aspects of that terrible war and portrays the intimate life of one New Zealand family in war-time.

We learn of a 20-year-old suffering from seasickness for much of the seven week journey to England; of Sling Camp, where young New Zealand soldiers faced hunger and death before even reaching the battle fields of France; of trench warfare and the inevitable consequences of 'going over the top'.

 The Pacific War was different: more 'downtime', more contact with the Japanese and Americans, closer to home, a shorter war. 

Fifteen men have been interviewed, six served in the Army; five in the Navy and four in the Air Force. Army experiences include the garrison in Fiji, life in New Caledonia, time in Guadalcanal and the attacks on Vella Lavella, Nissan/Green Island and Mono Island (the first opposed landing New Zealanders had taken part in since Gallipoli). There are men from the infantry, Divisional Signals, Medical Corps (Field Ambulance), Provosts (military police) and Army Service Corps.

"PR739",,1.0000,FALSE,1817,,"Waikanae Past And Present A History - Local History 248 pages",,"The Waikanae area has a long and fascinating history stretching back to the first Maori inhabitants. 

More recently, in the 1820s, Ngati Toa and Ngati Awa migrated to Waikanae, led by Te Rauparaha. 

The opening of the Wellington-Manawatu railway in 1886 brought pakeha settlers to work in the timber and flaxmilling industries and to clear the land for farming. Since World War II Waikanae has flourished as a leisure and retirement centre, its population exploding as new residents and holidaymakers have flocked to the Kapti Coast. 

In this book Chris & Joan Maclean have created a vivid and interesting picture of Waikanae past and present. Part 1 of the book focuses on Waikanae's social history, both Maori and Pakaha, while part two is concerned with the landscape and ecology of the area and with changes in land use over the years.

A well documented and well researched history of Jacksons Bay and the surrounding region. Jacksons Bay was identified as the only safe port on the West Coast. Its origins as a settlement date back to 1874 as a Government Special Settlement. Initially 80 families settled in the area of various ethnicities. 10 years later many had left because of the hardships. Others made a life. 100 years on Roxburgh records the development of the area, the life of coasters, a very different kind of life.

Art history in New Zealand had been dominated by landscape paintings, but there is a complementary field of portrait painting which has not received the same attention. This book redresses the balance a little by presenting a selection of self portraits by well-known New Zealand artists.

This Thing in the Mirror is not a comprehensive survey of New Zealand self-portraiture nor a thorough academic study. Instead, in a style intended to appeal to the general reader as well as the art specialist, it seeks to peel back a few layers, offer some illuminating points and ponderings, and drop an anecdote in here and there.

Claire Finlayson was born in Staffordshire, England, but brought up in New Zealand. She studied Art History at both the University of Canterbury and Victoria University of Wellington, and has worked at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and in the Pictorial Collections of the Hocken Library in Dunedin. She now works as a freelance writer.

This book chronicles the lives of these pioneering greengrocers and fruiterers as they carved their place into the countrys rich social and cultural tapestry. The personal anecdotes, historical documents and photos tell the stories of these families as they provided a vital service with a smile to their community and their journeys of growing up Kiwis. That includes the story of Colin Lowe of Norman Lowe Ltd in Whakatane: Being the son of a fruiterer meant you spent most of your spare time after school and in the weekends helping out. As a child I can still remember time spent unfolding unsold newspaper ready for wrapping veges in, unloading empty boxes and stacking them alongside the driveway ready for a carrier to collect them and take them to a market garden, sorting out the broken ones for repairing. These stories bring a unique perspective on New Zealands history as they trace the evolution of these shops from the general store-cum-greengrocery of the 1880s through to the fresh fruit and vegetable retailers we know today. It follows the fortunes and misfortunes of the Chinese in New Zealand through the hard times of the Depression and World War II, the growth and boom times of the 1950s and 60s and the challenge of supermarket giants 

 The appendices include a list of all known Chinese fruit shops from the 1880s to the current day, and maps of the Guangdong counties the Chinese fruiterers originated from. Both volumes are fully-illustrated with photos, graphs and statistical tables.

The Fruits of Our Labours was written and researched by Ruth Lam, Beverly Lowe, Helen Wong, Michael Wong, and Carolyn King.

It describes the struggle by men and women to house, feed and clothe themselves and their families, the efforts of political activists to bring about changes, and the responses of key political figures to the disastrous situation.

Though separated by distance and the long wait for post, the women of the Hall family sought to remain close to Britain while life in their new province took form. 

The collected letters focus on children, household duties, health, housing and servants, church, shopping, and social events.

 Preceding the annotated transcriptions of the letters is an enlightening introduction to the Hall family, which places them and the correspondence in an appropriate historical context that will appeal to history enthusiasts and casual readers alike.

 HW Richardson Group grew from its Southland base to become one of New Zealand's largest privately owned companies with transport, readymix concrete plants and other businesses throughout the country. 

Bill's story is told with humour and dignity; it's a story of achievement and success, hard work and tragedy. It's the philosophy of a man who recognised the value of family and friendship and how fair dealings must underpin all business transactions. 

Along the way Bill built up an impressive collection of vintage and old trucks in Invercargill, the largest collection in the country, visited by people from all over the world. Bill Richardson made a unique contribution to New Zealand business life and his story is a reminder that values still have a place in a fast-changing corporate world.

The history of the region is one of boom and bust associated with the exploitation of timber, gold and kauri gum. ln the nineteenth century the peninsula teemed with human activity and Thames was the third largest town in the country. Eventually the kauri and the accessible gold were exhausted and the gum market destroyed. The Coromandel . lapsed into an economic and social decline that was eventually halted by the gradual growth of farming, fishing and horticulture, a new forestry industry based on exotic trees, and as the land healed the development of tourism based on coastal settlements and regenerating bush.

 This book explores the ingredients of the Coromandel subculture in words and pictures. It brings the talents of New Zealand’s most distinguished documentaryiphotographer together with the gifts of one of the country's best known writers and historians. The result of this collaboration is an arresting and moving evocation of the history, landscape and lifestyle of the Coromandel Peninsula.
 

After taking the photographs for this book., Robin Morrison died while it was in production. For two decades he was one of New Zealand's most outstanding documentary and portrait photographers. He compiled or contributed to more than 20 books in New  Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom and attracted critical praise in all three countries. He won New Zealand Book Awards for South Island of New Zealand From the Road in 1982, and for his major retrospective At Home and Abroad in 1992.  

Robin Morrison (16 June 1944 - 12 March 1993) was a New Zealand documentary photographer, best known for his unpretentious portrayal of New Zealand countryside, everyday life and quirky architecture.

The definitive account of the New Zealand air crews' heroic and often deadly role in the dramatic and dangerous invasion of Europe in 1944 to the fall of Berlin the following year. 'Just another name, another place, another time for dying.'

 From hunting U-boats over the heaving waters of the cold Atlantic to dropping supplies for the Resistance and towing the gliders carrying paratroopers and weapons at Normandy, Arnhem and the Rhine crossing, the New Zealand airmen who fought with the RAF played an extraordinary role in the final chapters of World War II. 

In Victory, bestselling author Max Lambert shares the vivid, inspiring and previously unpublished stories of those young fliers - some still teenagers - who lived and died in the service of their country during the invasion of Normandy in 1944. Commemorating the 70th anniversary of D-Day and the beginning of the end of the war.

 Victory is both a thrilling account of courage and sacrifice, and a moving tribute to a passing generation of true heroes. PRAISE FOR MAX LAMBERT 'Night After Night is a classic'

INTRODUCTION :

This is a collection of some stories (of course, there are hundreds more)
from people who have come to share a special relationship with the Eltham
Town Hall. This registered historic building has served as a theatre for
live performance, a picture theatre and as a Town Hall for the Eltham
community.

The Eltham Town Hall has local and historical interest from the perspective
of individuals and the community, as their Historic landmark and focal point.
The hall has a grandeur that arrests attention mainly because of its size, style
and multi-function. Its acoustics are renowned and it has attracted many
lnterational artists over the years

In 1938 Lionel Hodgson followed in his father's footsteps and joined the New Zealand Shipping Company as an engineer. 

Twice torpedoed in the Second World War, he sailed in ships that carried vital cargoes to a beleaguered Britain. 

This book, written by his son, will be of great interest to seafarers and war historians as well as the general reader.

17 stories of early life from the early pioneer life in New Zealand as told to Christine Hunt

When Christine Hunt set out to recapture the memories of survivors of the generation born late last(19th) century, she unearthed an intricate tapestry of facts and feeling and home-grown philosophy, shrewd perception and tomfoolery and fantasy and faith: the essence of folk history.

In this book men and women of an almost bygone era speak frankly and with humour of their lives and times - ""Yes, and all those bloomimg personal bits and pieces"" that breathe life into history, They describe what its like to be near the end of their lives and physically failing, how it felt to live in New Zealand at the turn of the century and what they think of the world today. Above all, they spoke before it was too late, offering us a rare opportunity to share their responses to living and to share their memories of a past that is all too easily forgotten.'

Peter Graham's service as head guide at the Hermitage, Mount Cook, coincided with the 1st flowering of New Zealand Alpine climbing, 1894 -- 1928. He made many 1st climbs of the great peaks of the Central Southern Alps and he's alone earned him a great name in New Zealand mountaineering; but his work as a professional guide, founding a tradition of care and safe conduct in the parties he led, is an equally important contribution to the sport

Conditions quickly deteriorated as the Penguin reached Cook Strait. As the weather closed in, familiar landmarks disappeared. Unable to see Pencarrow light, Captain Francis Naylor set a course to steer clear of danger. After changing course again to ride out the storm, the ship struck rocks and began to sink in heavy seas.

The ‘women and children first’ custom proved disastrous as the lifeboats quickly capsized. No children and only one woman survived. Only 30 of the 102 people who set out from Picton made it ashore alive; contemporary accounts put the number on board at 105, with 75 deceased.

Although some said the Penguin had struck a drifting wreck, it is widely believed that it hit Thoms Rock off Cape Terawhiti. 

A subsequent inquiry blamed Captain Naylor and suspended his certificate for 12 months, despite finding he ‘did everything in his power to prevent loss of life’ once disaster struck.

'8 May, 1995. My alarm clock goes off at 6am. I get up and walk outside to survey the sky. Will we be going topdressing today?

 At 7am I leave with my first load, 900 kg. I land back four or five minutes later when the Fletcher is reloaded. Climbing away from the base of the airstrip in a northerly direction, I see the sun starting to appear on the horizon. I drop the first half of this load .

' A minute later the Fletcher smashes into a paddock and slides 44 metres, then slews to the right before coming to a stop in an upright position. It takes emergency crews an hour-and-a half to cut Barry Cardno from the wreckage. 

Aim for the Sky captures the spirit and heart of a young man on the verge of carrying out his dream, the dream of flying. The author ably conveys a youthful keenness and enthusiasm for flying and for life: the reader is right there with him in the cockpit, feeling his excitement and airborne rapture. But we also witness his fears and the disillusionment he feels about his employers, the loneliness and solitary nature of the work he undertook, and the dangers inherent in topdressing rural New Zealand.

When the Germans invaded Crete in 1941, taking thousands of Allied prisoners, little could they have known what an irritation one of them would be. Young N.Z. soldier, Sandy Thomas, was severely wounded and unable to be evacuated with his comrades. The first aid post where he was lying was first bombed, then captured by German paratroopers and Sandy was sent to a Prisoner of War hospital in Greece. From here, despite his gaping leg wound, he made several daring attempts at escape.
All, including one in which he feigned death so he could be carried out of the camp in a coffin, were unsuccessful. Finally, his nuisance value became so great that he was sent to a specially guarded camp at Salonika. From here he achieved his amazing escape followed by nearly a year trying to avoid recapture.
He found shelter on the famous Holy Mountain - a rocky peninsula populated solely by monks, where no female had been allowed for hndreds of years. He was shuffled constantly from one monastery to another as the Germans came and went in their search. Some monasteries were generous and hospitable to the young Kiwi, while other were hostile and afraid.
Ass the while, Thomas was impatiently searching for an opportunity to rejoin his regiment. Eventually, thanks to his zest for life and adventure, he reached Turkey in a stolen boat - setting the scene for another amazing story told for the first time in this edition

 A History of Meteorology in New Zealand by J. F. de Lisle.

 The history of mankind abounds with accounts of attempts to influence the weather: in early times through incantations, dances and gifts, and sacrifices to or covenant with, the gods and in more recent times purposeful alteration of the physical or chemical state of the atmosphere - so intertwined is the life of man with his natural environment.

Although nearly 90% of the population of Great Britain remained civilians throughout the war, or for a large part of it, their story has so far largely gone untold.

 In contrast with the thousands of books on military operations, barely any have concerned themselves with the individual's experience. The problems of the ordinary family are barely ever mentioned - food rationing, clothes rationing, the black-out and air raids get little space, and everyday shortages almost none at all.

 This book is an attempt to redress the balance; to tell the civilian's story largely through their own recollections and in their own words. ""Mr Longmate has recruited an enormous volunteer army of home-front veterans who sent him their wartime recollections...He has brilliantly sifted and assembled the precious debris

Compiled by the historical adviser to the TV series ""The 1940s House,"" this is an engagingly written social chronicle of wartime civilian life in England from September 1939 to August 1945—from the grandeurs of the Blitz to the miseries of dried egg powder—with numerous individual testimonies.

Bob Flatt brings to life many of his hair-raising adventures and the characters he met along the way. It tells of a world before technology took over, when each cattle station was its own self-contained community, drovers still roamed the land and the spirit of mateship was a matter of life and death.

Hidden in the remote uninhabited hills beyond Motueka near the top of the South Island, reached only by a slim and seldom used packtrack, Henry Fox Chaffey and his wife Annie kept an immaculate one-roomed hut. 

He was born in a well-to-do Somerset family; she left her violent husband and two sons, fearing vengeance. It was seven years before Annie saw another woman, but even a broken leg wouldn't later tear her away. Henry tracked goods in and out and was involved in various ways with many people, but apart from the occasional visitor Annie liked in isolation for nearly 40 years.

Ewen William Alison was born in Auckland, New Zealand, on leap day, 29 February 1852, the son of Jane Cameron and her husband, Alexander Alison, a shipwright. The family moved to Devonport in 1854, and Ewen went to the Church of England School, North Shore. At the age of 13 he took his first job as a compositor with the New Zealand Herald. In 1867 he departed to join the Thames goldrush. The eldorado eluded him, but he made sufficient money to join his brother, Alexander, in a butchery partnership in Devonport the following year. To assist in this business, leases of the islands of Motuihe and Motukorea (Browns Island) were taken up for running stock. Later, Ewen set up in business on his own as an estate agent to assist in the disposal of land he had acquired in the Devonport area.

 The Gurkhas have been staunch friends in every war fought by Great Britain and they have proved to be an unusually effective fighting force

 In the Second World War, nearly a quarter of a million came down from the hills of Nepal to fight against Germany and Japan -- each and every one being a volunteer -- and throughout the 19th century and onto the Falklands campaign in 1982, the Gurkha regiments were continually used to support British colonial interests. 

Their renown in battle earned the respect of friend and foe; their valor has won countless decorations for gallantry, including thirteen Victoria Crosses.

. Continuing the Excellent work of firstly Laurence Pomeroy and later L.J.K. Setright, Doug Nye carries on this formidable task, that was left at the close of the 1.5 litre G.P. Formula in 1965. This excellent work takes the story on through the doubling of engine size to 3 litres, the commencment of aerodynamic aids, both above (wings), and below (skirts), plus many side appendages (trim) if such a word exists? If it does'nt, then it should! 

Some now outlawed and others so far developed, as to have very little in relation to the initial efforts. Turbo engines came and went, even Turbines and all this is still in living memory for many of us. Never has there been so much going on in the ever spiralling World of 'Big Money' Grand Prix Car Design and Development. This Book takes the story another 21 years on to 1985. 264 pages of text, photo and illustration make this large format volume essential in your Library

The story of a 10 year courtship told through diaries and letters from the Great War and rural New Zealand.

 Between 1916-19 Len Wilton, a young Wairarapa farmer, was 'away at the war', serving on the Western Front, including at Passchendaele. Unwell, and close to a breakdown, he later spent time at Brockenhurst Hospital in England. Meanwhile, at home, neighbouring farmer's daughter Ilma McLachlan carried on with her life which she recorded in her diaries. 

Len's letters to his 'Chick' and Ilma's diaries form the heart of this book which also records their early and later lives.

 Lyall Bay is on the south coast of Wellington city, next to the airport and patrols Lyall Bay beach.

 The history of 100 years of the Lyall Bay Surf Life Saving Club was written by prominent historian Dr Gavin McLean, it tells the story of the early development of Lyall Bay - its popularity rocketed when trams reached there in 1909/1910 - and the fascinating history of the people and events that have shaped the beach and the club.

 It covers the modern day club and also has a chapter on Wellington Ladies (1940-1976).It is a very readable, well illustrated book.

There were many ways for a combat crew to die during Bomber Command's war of 1944.

 Over German territory, bursts of heavy flak could tear the wings from their planes in a split second. Flaming bullets from German fighter planes could explode their fuel tanks, cut their oxygen supplies, destroy their engines.

 In the spring of that year, thousands of young men were shot, blown up, or thrown from their planes five miles above the earth; and even those who returned faced the subtler dangers of ice and fog as they tried to land their battered aircraft back home. The winter of 1944 was the most dangerous time to be a combat airman in RAF Bomber Command. 

The chances of surviving a tour were as low as one in five, and morale had finally hit rock bottom. In this comprehensive history of the air war that year, Kevin Wilson describes the most dangerous period of the Battle of Berlin, and the unparalleled losses over Magdeburg, Leipzig and Nuremberg. He tells how ordinary men coped with constant pressure of flying, the loss of their colleagues, and the threat of death or capture. 

And, by telling the story of the famous events of this period - the Great Escape, D-Day, the defeat of the V1 menace - he shows how, through sheer grit and determination, the 'Men of Air' finally turned the tide against the Germans.

This book describes the life of early Sydney in extracts from a varied collection of letters, journals, books, documents and despatches, skilfully arranged in the form of a diary. 

John Cobley has let the writers and observers of the time tell their story without footnotes or comments of his own, and the entries are for the most part first-hand accounts, written down not months or years later but as they occurred.

 This gives them a special intimacy and vitality. The story is of a near-starving colony struggling to make something of life in the midst of almost unbelievable difficulties.

 Again and again we read of hunger, illness and death, of petty crime and floggings, of droughts, bushfires and floods. But these things are inseparable from any account of early Sydney, and in fact a great deal was being achieved. 

By the early 1790s the populations was increasing, and the town was beginning to take shape, and the boundries were widening as settlement spread from its beginnings at Sydney Cove and from the farming centre of Rose Hill. This book is a fine contribution to a series which is filling an important historical gap. Further volumes are planned up to the year 1803, when the Sydney Gazette, Australia's first newspaper, made its appearance.

The State of Victoria in Australia has few published accounts of its first settlements, unlike New South Wales. Nicholas Pateshall's journal, edited by Marjorie Tipping, is the first of a proposed series of small publications related to the early settlement of Port Phillip and Van Diemen's Land. Nicholas Pateshall is a little-known name in Australian history. He was the third lieutenant on the convict ship H.M.S. Calcutta, which set sail for New Holland on 26 April, 1803, on an expedition to collect naval timber and to establish a settlement in the newly discovered bay on the northern shore of the Bass Strait. Coupled with these aims was the genuine concern that France might try to gain a sphere of influence in New Holland, and the importance of opening up a sealing industry since the discovery of Bass Strait emphasised the need to secure a port in the area. 

Nicholas Pateshall's small journal is a simple and factual account that records events and impressions with sincerity and perception. Marjorie Tipping concludes the account of Pateshall's life in these words: ""Nicholas Pzateshill spent only five months in Australia. It might be said that he contributed little to its development or history. But the slender journal he kept and the sketch of his life tell something of one who was perhaps typical of many of the young naval officers who had the responsibility of delivering their human cargo safely, who showed concern for their well-being, and who have gained little recognition in our historical records. One wonders whether, in later life, he ever looked back upon the days he spent hunting and fishing at Port Phillip, the time he shot the big kangaroo and caught the black swans on Mud Island."" This 'first fleet' journal for the state of Victoria is a delightful first-hand account of the heritage we possess and enjoy today.

There are few memorials to colonial businesswomen, but if you know where to look you can find many traces of their presence as you wander the streets of Sydney. From milliners and dressmakers to ironmongers and booksellers; from publicans and boarding-house keepers to butchers and taxidermists; from school teachers to ginger-beer manufacturers: these women have been hidden in the historical record but were visible to their contemporaries. 

Catherine Bishop brings the stories of these entrepreneurial women to life, with fascinating details of their successes and failures, their determination and wilfulness, their achievements, their tragedies and the occasional juicy scandal.

 Until now we have imagined colonial women indoors as wives, and mothers, domestic servants or prostitutes. This book sets them firmly out in the open.

The books style was ahead of its time — Colin is humorous at times but always paints a vivid image when retelling his hunting experiences.

Due to the massive number of hunting hours undertaken, he has many amusing or unusual anecdotes to share. These stories are about hunting red deer in the Wairarapa and South Westland and wapiti in Fiordland during the 1950s and 1960s.

 To quote Colin, at the time of publishing, he reckoned he’d spent 1,500 days in the bush, 9,000 hours on hunting trips, including 127 days in Fiordland and 35 in South Westland.

Colin was a very successful trophy hunter and he recounts his stories of securing many 40? length Wairarapa red deer heads and an outstanding 52? wapiti bull rack.

What makes this book extra special are Colin’s photos. Colin was able to capture some amazing live animal images and so this book has many more images than its contemporaries of the time

In 1848, in order to control the use of ""wastelands"" or Crown land, the Crown formed the six Hundreds of the County of Eden. Along with Takapuna, Devonport was included in the Hundred of Pupuke. The Hundred was dissolved in 1854.

This book is not a definitive history of Devonport - such a history has yet to be written. Instead it is a celebration of the local community which provides a series of images of our recent past. Anyone reflecting on his or her own past will appreciate that the very recounting of historical events can distort and confuse the actual reality, but this publication has, I hope, painted a faithful history of the Devonport Borough.

The individual contributors, most of whom are Devonport residents, have evoked between them a lively picture of our small community, which although so typical of New Zealand, is also splendidly unique.

With numerous quotations from people who had lived the backblocks life. Supported by a wide selection of old photographs together with illustrations by the author.

Encouraged by his initial success he produced another two popular works, Hunter by Profession (1973) and Backblocks (1974). Over the next three decades, Holden gained a dedicated following and reputation amongst the rural and outdoor/ hunting community of New Zealand and Australia.

 ECHUCA is a town located on the banks of the Murray River and Campaspe River in VIctoria. The border town of Moama is adjacent on the northern side of the Murray River in New South Wales. Echuca is the administrative centre and largest settlement in the Shire of Campaspe. At the time of the 2016 census, Echuca had a population of 12,906. The population of the combined Echuca and Moama townships was estimated to be 20,660 at June 2016. 

Echuca lies within traditional Yorta Yorta country. The town's name is an Aboriginal word meaning ""meeting of the waters"".Echuca is situated close to the junction of the Goulburn, Campaspe, and Murray Rivers. Its position at the closest point of the Murray to Melbourne contributed to its development as a thriving river port city during the 19th century. 

History
Foundation
Echuca was founded by one of the most enterprising figures of the early colonial period, an ex-convict named Henry Hopwood. In 1850 he purchased a small punt to ferry people and goods across the Murray River near the Campaspe junction. 

As the relatively small settlement known as Hopwood's Ferry grew, it became the town of Echuca. The Hopwood's Punt Post Office opened around 1854 and was renamed Echuca Post Office on 1 January 1855.

FREDERICK GEORGE MOORE

Master mariner and coastal pioneer, is best known as the discoverer of Wakatu, or Nelson Haven, lying behind its natural breakwater, the Boulder Bank, in 1841, but more than that, he was closely associated with the very roots of colonisation. 

He saw the infant settlements of Wellington, New Plymouth Wanganui and Nelson at their most formative stages, he knew Blind (Tasman) Bay better than any other mariner of his day, and the part he played in the selection of a site for the Nelson Colony was probably greater than has generally been realised. 

He was a man of many parts. He was a vigorous champion of steamship services for New Zealand, he stage managed the New Zealand display at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, was an early settler at Motueka, an original Liberal, and a vocal supporter of land reform. He was in turn, mariner, explorer, surveyor, coastal trader, farmer, coal miner and politician, a man of restless nature, not unfamiliar with adversity, a contemporary of the Wake- fields, life long friend of Charles Heaphy, and a staunch believer in the country he had adopted as a pioneer. 

In presenting his biography, the author has made much use of Moore’s own papers, but carried his research into other available sources, both in New Zealand and overseas, with the result that, rather than a biography, the work has become a study of many aspects of colonisation itself.

The work of Joseph Zachariah has a charm and fascination all of its own - especially when it comes to reflecting social customs during the first decade of the 20th century. 

There were two things that shaped Zachariah's career as a photographer - first there was the pomp and ceremony of events in Wellington such as New Zealand being declared a Dominion in 1907. Coinciding with these times, the ubiquitous postcard made its appearance and began to enthrall everyone a something that was eminently collectible.

Ten years later, after serving as Minister of Finance in the Coalition Government during the Depression, his reputation has sunk to its lowest ebb. He went on to serve with distinction in the War Cabinet, winning the confidence and respect of his Labour colleagues.

"PR983","war",1.0000,FALSE,1952,,"Commando To Colditz War Hero  Michael 'Micky' Burn Colditz Prisoner Of War",,"A compelling, riveting read, Commando to Colditz is an unusual perhaps unique war story. It is centered around a most unusual war hero  Michael 'Micky' Burn, soldier, poet and novelist, whose journey from fascist follower, to commander of Six Troop, to Commando, to prisoner (and communist lecturer) in the notorious prison of Colditz forms the focal point of this powerful narrative.

In 1942 Micky led his commando troop of 28 men on one of the most daring raids of the Second World War, the assault on the French port of St Nazaire.
 As a result of this 'night of fire and death', fourteen of Micky's men were killed; seven, including Burn, were captured. 

Micky's bond with his soldiers is at the story's heart. Before the raid, he had asked his parents to write to his men's families if the worst should happen; the result was the creation of a rich and moving archive of letters between these grieving or anxious families, letters that illuminate the lives and deaths of a small but close-knit group of British soldiers and those who loved them.

Coast Watchers Of The Solomons WWII D C Horton 

Guadalcanal was almost an unknown name in 1937 when young Dick Horton was posted to the Solomons. 

In 1942 he was swept into the arena where the United States and the Australian and New Zealand allies fought it out with the armed forces of Japan. After a short period of evacuation to Australia, where he eventually succeeded in fretting himself clear of the permanent civilian status imposed on him by Officialdom, his knowledge of the Solomons earned him a place with the 1st Raider Battalion of the US Marine Corps.

 Later he was commissioned as Lieutenant, RANVR, in the Coastwatching service of the Royal Australian Navy but still maintained his close liaison with the US Marines. 

This book tells his story and that of his companion Coast Watchers in those dangerous days - - enlisting the devoted aid of the islanders, reporting Japanese sea, air and land activities, helping Allied airmen to safety, and occasionally - though this was not their primary function - harrying and harassing the Japanese forces in the Solomons.

 A particularly interesting feature of the book is the inside story of the rescue of Lieutenant John F. Kennedy and the crew of PT 109 by Reg Evans and his islander Coast Watchers - but this is only one of scores of incidents that grip the reader's attention. Mr. Horton's description of his landing on Tulagi with the 1st Raider Battalion, for example is a memorable study in suspense. In his earlier book, The Happy Isles, the author drew an idyllic picture of island life before the war. In this new book it is fascinating to see how an apparently primitive people adapted themselves to survival in the war raging around and above them, and with what outstanding courage, cunning and devotion they served the Allied cause.

Popular rural writer Philip Holden visits New Zealand back-country stations and meets the people who have forged an existence in some of the most remote parts of the country. Each station has its own remarkable history. Some families have been working these stations for generations, facing many of the same conditions as their forebears. On some stations working life has barely changed since the 19th century, and mustering is still carried out in the traditional way on horseback.

Written in Philip Holden's inimitable style and illustrated throughout with his stunning colour photographs, this collection reflects Holden's true affinity with the land and its people.

Bartolo Barnao first sailed into Wellington in 1902, aged 13, and began work in the fish trade.

 Eight years later he revisited Stromboli to marry the bride who had been chosen for him by the parish priest in his village. Bartolo and Giuseppa returned to New Zealand and raised their five children in Palmerston North and Wellington.

 In this fascinating book, Italian literary scholar Vincent Moleta traces the story of his grandparents’ childhood on Stromboli at the end of the 19th century of Bartolo’s year as a cabin boy on a steam trawler sailing out of Napier of his two years driving a cart of freshly caught fish through the night from Makara Beach to the fish market in Wellington

After of the death in 1911 of the couple’s first child the family company set up by Bartolo and his brother Giuseppe, which came to dominate the fish trade in the central North Island.

 We learn of the enormous family rupture 1930 that saw Bartolo sell up and move to Wellington, settling in Island Bay and establishing, in the teeth of the Great Depression, Barnao’s Fish Market in Lambton Quay, which became a Wellington institution. 

Vincent Moleta paints a lively picture of life in Island Bay, New Zealand’s ‘Little Italy’, from 1900 to the 1960s: of the Catholic tennis club socials and the Fascist club meetings of the 1930s; of Italian weddings; of the New Zealand tour of the Italian grand opera company in 1949.

 He weaves these events and themes into a moving account of the family’s moments of joy and sorrow

The incredible stories of the New Zealanders who have been awarded the Victoria Cross for courage under fire, from WWI to the war in Afghanistan.
Here are the stories of the 27 men who won the Victoria Cross in both world wars and in Afghanistan in the 21st century - fighting heroes who risked their own lives to save their fellow men or change the course of a military action. All three services are represented here, and the stirring stories of wing walkers, daring raids, courageous advances against huge odds, and awe-inspiring courage under fire make it a fascinating and invaluable addition to our historical record for children.

A simple introduction to each man is followed by an account of how he won his award, and what happened to him afterwards. Poignant and inspiring, the tales of self sacrifice courage and extraordinary deeds by otherwise ordinary men in the field of battle will provide excellent background material for history and language units. An excellent resource for motivating reluctant readers, especially boys, and well suited to classroom and individual reading.

Best and Bravest is the children's version of the fully revised and updated In the Face of the Enemy, (also publishing in 2016) and includes the story of Corporal Williw Apiata, the most recent soldier to be awarded the VC.

 64-year-old former dual national boxing champion and light welterweight winner, who has spent 23 years on the project which tracks his family's storied involvement with the sport.

""The wider context of the wording is the battle we all face during life. It's not about just reaching out to fighters, it's relevant to people battling cancer, battling to hold a business or marriage together ... everything.""

Enright, who struggled with depression, credits wife, Nan, for helping him through his darkest moments.

""I wouldn't be where I am today if not for her help. She's a priceless little gem. It would have been easy for her to walk away but she stuck in there.

""I wasn't a bad person - I was just dealing with something I didn't know what it was. I wasn't man enough to go and ask for help. The result was it knocked me over.

""The message in the book is clear - don't be an idiot, put that staunch thing away and get out and get it treated.""

The book also explores the career of Denny's father, Bill Enright, who won the national amateur title in 1939 from which he was selected for the cancelled 1940 Helsinki Olympics.

Thanks to tireless work from boxing historian and regular Bay of Plenty Times contributor Barry Leabourne, Bill was presented with his New Zealand blazer pocket alongside Tommy Dunn and trainer Son Tall more than half a century later.

""The thing with the blazer pocket was I didn't know how much it meant to him,"" said Enright.

""Six days out from his dying day I asked him what was the greatest thing he ever got out of boxing. He pointed his finger up to his silver fern badge.""

The author of two critically acclaimed books on Captain Cook, John Robson has now turned his attention to the decade leading up to Cook's famous 1768 expedition to the Pacific. 

Through his own skills and application, James Cook rose up through the ranks of the Royal Navy to become a remarkable seaman and men of influence took notice of him. Generals such as Wolfe and politicians like Lord Egmont took his advice and recognised his qualities.

 During this period, Cook added surveying, astronomical and cartographic skills to those of seamanship and navigation. He was in the thick of the action at the siege of Quebec during the Seven Years War, was the master of 400 men, and learned at first hand the need for healthy crews. By the time he lead the Endeavour expedition to the Pacific in 1768, he had become supremely and uniquely qualified for the exacting tasks of exploration. 


Cook scholars and armchair explorers alike will appreciate this important new study.

An outstanding story of an amazing man. His excellent memory and careful filing of information over the years has resulted in the production of this autobiography. 

John Mackie's work in geology and then as an Inspector of Mines in Malaya was followed by his wartime experience. 

After being captured by the Japanese he spent three terrible years in the infamous Changi and Batu Lintang prison camps. 

When he returned to New Zealand his main task in the 1950s was teaching land and mine surveying in Otago. 

This is when he became known affectionately as Captain Jack. It is a measure of the man that at the age of 97 he can produce a book that will appeal to a wide audience.

In an entirely new approach and to interest a wider audience Pat Lawlor has assembled a book of much appeal.
True, the locale is in most chapters Wellington City, but the book has in addition theatrical, musical, political and environmental content; his subjects range from seagulls to violins. It gives a composite picture of the Great Harbour of Tara; an exciting chapter on Cook Strait; others include tramways and cable cars; the 1913 Strike; famous dogs and cabbies and a nostalgic look at Silverstream in the Hutt Valley. The romance of Cuba Street, where the author was born, is followed by the first complete account of Mount Victoria. The author is well known for bringing alive the Wellington of days gone by with an entertaining and easily read style. This time he has used a wealth of illustrations, some in colour and much of it published for the first time.

""For more than five years I had dreamed of a new adventure,"" writes Sir Edmund Hillary, ""to travel with a group of friends from the mouth of the Ganges River upstream against the current as far as we could go ... up into the mountains where the river had its beginnings."" In 1977 the 'Ocean to Sky' expedition turned that dream into reality; this is Hillary's own dramatic record of that journey.

The 1500-mile-long trek provided as many challenges as the conqueror of Everest and his crew had imagined, from powering jet boats up treacherous rapids to the ultimate test of climbing Akash Parbat, above which, according to Hindu tradition, the lord Shiva received the celestial stream of Ganga into the matted locks of his hair. Hillary's narrative, supplemented with excerpts from his crew's journals and many photographs, captures the excitement and danger of the expedition.

But From the Ocean to the Sky is far more than a simple adventure story. It is a rich and intimate encounter with the tigers of the Sunderbans, with Hindu holy men and Sikh pilgrims, with rural Bengali villagers and hysterical Calcutta crowds. at every teeming city ghat and wharf, at each remote refueling stop, the people of India - fishermen, city dignitaries, village elders, excited schoolchildren, ancient porters, yogis - all responded with an outpouring of warmth and enthusiasm to honor the Western travelers whose pilgrimage up the holy river symbolized so much for those along the banks.

The story of Hillary's exhilarating journey and this rare view into the heart and soul of India will prove as irresistable as the mysterious lure of Mother Ganga itself

Herbert Hart

2009 - World War  1914-1918


When feisty Carterton lawyer Herbert Hart left New Zealand in 1914 to serve as a major with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, he never dreamed he would return home as a much-decorated brigadier-general.

Capable, personable and decisive, his swift rise through the ranks saw him command the Wellington Battalion during the closing stages of the Gallipoli campaign then serve as a battalion and brigade commander on the Western Front, notably at the Somme and Passchendale, from 1916 until the end of the ""war to end all wars"".

Like many of his countrymen Hart kept a diary of his experiences, now regarded as one of the most important personal sources relating to the NZEF. A born diarist, it is his factual, understated style that makes his eyewitness account of the war all the more powerful. Horrific details of day-to-day fighting in France, the injuries his men suffered (Hart too was wounded) and the deaths of comrades are revealed. Shocking too are his observations about the effects of millions of rats inhabiting the trenches, and the bitterly cold winters.
Thanks to Hart's rank we are also privy to the remarkable organisation and logistics that lay behind every battle, not to mention a discreet letting off of steam when the brass got it wrong.

There are poetic moments, too, as when the author describes a spring garden bursting forth in the grounds of his billet, or, when driving from X to Y on military business, he sees a French farmer working the fields in a tranquil landscape, just a few kilometres from the front.
Balancing the high tension (and occasional boredom) of combat are his descriptions of leave in France, England and Scotland; the surprise here is how in many respects life away from the front – dinners, the theatre, parties – carried on as usual.

Thanks to Hart's rank we are also privy to the remarkable organisation and logistics that lay behind every battle, not to mention a discreet letting off of steam when the brass got it wrong.

There are poetic moments, too, as when the author describes a spring garden bursting forth in the grounds of his billet, or, when driving from X to Y on military business, he sees a French farmer working the fields in a tranquil landscape, just a few kilometres from the front.
Balancing the high tension (and occasional boredom) of combat are his descriptions of leave in France, England and Scotland; the surprise here is how in many respects life away from the front – dinners, the theatre, parties – carried on as usual.

The Holm Shipping Companys history extends through three generations, its roots being in 1880. Swedish born Ferdinand Holm entered the shipping business with a share in the barque ""Malay"". His son Sydney Holm and later his grandson John Holm together built a fleet of ships not just trading around the coasts of New Zealand but also voyaging to Australia and the Pacific islands.

 The company has had its hardships and tragedies, notably the Holmburn catching fire with the loss of two lives and the mysterious disappearance of the Holmglen lost with all hands off the coast of Timaru, the sinking of the Holmwood in 1940 by a German Raider and the wreck of the Holmbank in 1963 in Peraki Bay. The book also records the interesting and often humourous incidents, along with the colourful personalities. 

The Holm Shipping Company has played a significant part in New Zealand history, particularly maritime aspects of it. A incredibly interesting book that helps one appreciate the changes in shipping and also an appreciation is gained of how reliant New Zealand once was on shipping as the prime bulk mover of cargo around the country.

Description: Softcover. Very good condition. Little Book No. 7. Small square format. Pictorial card wraps. 

Two children, Jack and Mary, are sent to live with their Uncle John on his farm for a 'long' time and they're terribly excited about it. After only a few opening sentences they've already arrived so we can't be sure whether they were accompanied or sent on a train alone. Jack looks about eight and his sister approximately seven, but in those days (1944) it wasn't all that uncommon for children to travel by themselves. Maybe Jack and Mary experienced an evacuation of sorts because in those days many children were photographed boarding trains that took them to safer centres or countryside locales for protection from Nazi bombs. But then again, a picture features the children standing by a signpost depicting: ""To Apple Tree Farm,"" so who knows? They may have lived nearby and walked from the village, or perhaps got off a train and were on their way to the farm.

One man's memoir of World War II which took him from the Blitz to the jungles of Burma, to the devastation of Hiroshima.'I consider myself lucky to have survived the global carnage still myself  a reluctant soldier who had to go to war, who only ever wanted peace for everyone.' Brian HennessyBrian immigrated to New Zealand after the war and lived there until his death aged ninetytwo, but he never forgot his extraordinary war adventures. This is his story.Born in Germany to English parents, Brian Hennessy came from a family who served in the army. He was seventeen years old and living in London when war broke out. He experienced the Blitz firsthand. Brian joined the British Army and upon graduating, he became the youngest armament artificer. What follows is a true adventure story as Brian journeys via South Africa to India and the remote jungles of Burma. Danger was always present, and his narrative is sometimes humorous, at other times poignant. At the end of war, he went to Japan and saw firsthand the devastation at Hiroshima.

A  unique New Zealand high-country farmer and her historic sheep station. New Zealand's high country farmers are a special breed. They farm in tough terrain, at high altitudes, in areas where extreme climate puts both man and animal to the test. When she was widowed, with three children, in 1992 Iris Scott had to call on all her farming skill and inner strength to carry on as the runholder of the 150-year-old, 18,000-hectare Rees Valley Station at the head of Lake Wakatipu, near Glenorchy. Not only that, she had to run the station on her own and keep up her veterinary practice. High Country Woman is the engaging story of Iris Scott's love of our high country and her determination to farm it successfully while upholding high conservation and land-guardianship values. The book also covers the fascinating history of the area long known to locals as The Head of the Lake, the focus of William Rees' great sheep run, established not long after he and Nicolas von Tunzelman became two of the earliest Europeans to travel into the area in an epic exploration feat in 1860.
About the Author

Iris Scott is one of the first New Zealand women to graduate from the Massey University veterinary science degree. She moved to Rees Valley Station in 1971 when she married Graeme Scott, son of the then runholders Doug and Jean Scott. She is a member of the Otago Conservation Board and a passionate advocate of the high country way of life.

By Jeanette Cook 

Inside New Zealand craft artists’ studios 

Crafted by Design is a story not only of Kiwi ingenuity but also of world class artistic endeavour. In fact it's 55 stories, providing a vibrant cross-section of New Zealand's contemporary craft-art scene. The book takes the reader into the studios of some of this country's leading craft artists, ranging from pioneers of the mid-20th century studio craft movement to emerging younger talent beginning to make their mark in the new century.

 Stephen Robinson's photographs capture the artists and their work in full colour. Jeanette Cook's text outlines the inspiration and processes involved, the changes New Zealand craft art has seen, and the emergence of exciting new design elements. 

The materials the artists use are sometimes commonplace, but the finished products shown here never are. From glasswork to guitars, hats to hei tiki, tapestry to teapots, and masks to moko, each is an individual work of enduring value. Many will be found in museum collections in years to come. 

But Crafted by Design displays them where they are most at home: in the natural environment, and in the studios of their creators. This book, itself a thing of beauty, is a fine tribute to the achievements of New Zealand craft artists.

Remarkable Stories of Survival From the 2011 Canterbury Earthquake

It was all so sudden. Twenty seconds and then silence. I started calling out, 'Can anyone hear me?' - nothing but silence.

 Over the next few hours I heard hysterical sobbing and people clapping as others were rescued. I could hear engines, drilling and what sounded like sledgehammers ...when the sounds went away I worried they weren't coming back.' Ann Bodkin, trapped for 25 hours.

 The Canterbury earthquake of February 2011 altered landscape, history, and most importantly, human lives. Many perished and the lives of thousands were upended.

 In Trapped, Martin van Beynen documents with sensitivity and unerring detail the personal experiences of more than thirty quake survivors - before, during and after the event - in their own words. At once poignant, dramatic and enthralling, their stories record a defining moment in Canterbury's history and testify to the courage and heroism of everyday people.

Te Wairoa was established by the Christian missionary in 1848 as a model village, however Te Wairoa survived for fewer
than 40 years before it, and the nearby Pink and White Terraces were obliterated by the eruption of Mt Tarawera.

Violent and unexpected, the volcanic eruption of Mt Tarawera on 10 June 1886 was one of New Zealand's greatest natural disasters. For more than four terrifying hours rocks, ash, and mud bombarded the peaceful village of Te Wairoa ending more than 150 lives and destroying the eighth wonder of the world - the Pink and White Terraces

From its earliest days, New Zealand has viewed Russia's presence in the Pacific as the main external threat. 

Professor Barratt, a specialist on Russian history, has examined New Zealand archives and uncovered a mixture of comedies of errors, and of deft attempts by the New Zealand Government to use the threat of Russian expansion in the Pacific as a leaver to obtain financial assistance from Great Britain. 

Editorials. letters, reports, cartoons even, have been used for this picture of a serio-comic episode in the history of the South Pacific. At the same time, it is a scholarly contribution to the emerging history of the Pacific basin as a whole

The story begins at the outbreak of war when Doug and a few friends were partying at the Chateau. They all volunteered in September 1939 when they returned to Auckland. Doug had initial training at Levin and Whenuapai. 

The book brilliantly captures the thrills of flying as well as the many other emotions associated with warfare including the loss of fellow airmen and the anticipation of battle. 

This frank account of New Zealand Spitfire pilot Doug Brown traces his training and action experienced in the RAF and social activities during the war. From ‘signing up’ as a young 20 year old when World War II broke out in 1939, he ventured to Canada on the Awatea with 200 trainees and then on to England.

The first solo in a Spitfire was almost his last and he crashed on his first operation with 485 Squadron. It was a life of contrasts: the thrill of flying; the loss of fellow airmen; anticipation of combat; the boredom of ‘readiness’; indulgent mess banquets; rough conditions; pranks and comradeship; and the unrelenting toil of war. None would deny the effect the intensive active service would have on the mental and physical state of pilots and all servicemen. Boys quickly became men and survivors would claim they were the best years of their lives.

Reed, Auckland, 1999 

From the early days of European settlement to today's high-tech engineering marvels from the first road and railways projects to America's Cup yachts and Auckland's Sky Tower New Zealand has a truly impressive engineering heritage. In 1990, the Institution of Professional Engineers of New Zealand (IPENZ) selected a number of significant engineering projects for special awards to mark their sesquicentennial year. These projects, plus others that have qualified since, are brought to life in this book by professional historian Matthew Wright. 

Heavily illustrated with both historical and modern photographs, New Zealand's Engineering Heritage presents an impressive record of engineering works large and small from one end of the country to the other. Many, such as the Raurimu spiral and the Hamilton jet engine, are famous throughout New Zealand, while others like the Bluff all-weather package loaders are better known within their local communities

Over 65 projects, spanning more than 130 years, feature in this record of engineering works that have contributed to the shape of New Zealand today.

Paul Tritenbach traces the development of New Zealand's best known parks from their establishment, through to the present day. 

It is divided into 19 chapters, each giving an historical chronology of a particular park, using photographs, maps and text. 

The historic photographs and maps are superb, and tell much about the development of these parks and the early plantings of exotics. 

They show what a tremendous resource is stored in our museums and libraries, and how valuable photographic material can be as an historic record.

The author has been selective in the parks chosen, and tried to include those that are largest and oldest as well as those that show historical differences.

The rehabilitation people gave Clough Blair exactly two hours in which to find a cargo ship for sale, to muster a complete crew of ex-servicemen, and to think up a case for a loan with which to buy the ship and launch a shipping line. He was successful. He and his mates defied the marine experts, the financial magnates, the professional pessimists - and the Big Brothers of the overseas-owned shipping lines, and launched their little Tasman Shipping Company into prosperous waters. 
They carried trans-Tasman frozen cargoes, they picked up coastwise freights, they earned the respect and co-operation of shippers and wharfies and port authorities - and, the less friendly interest of the Big Boys in the game. They assembled a fleet of little ships that were not sleek, photogenic ocean greyhounds - their ships looked, in fact, more like a rabbiter's pack of mixed breeds - and they prospered, breaking all records for the quick turnaround of cargo ships in New Zealand ports. 
Things were going well . . . Then the shoestring snapped. In all good faith the Company had put its trust in certain astute and plausible gentlemen in Singapore, and had so become pawns in a game that was too big, too murky . . .
This is no hard-luck story. Clough Blair is not the man to blubber over spilt milk. What he writes in this book is the gay, adventurous story of a handful of tough Kiwi mariners who laughed in the face of the experts who said ""it couldn't be done"", and proved them wrong. Readers of this book will enjoy the fun - they may also find reason to be thoughtful about the overseas-owned shipping lines on whom New Zealand's prosperity depends . .

In mid-winter 1944, massive infantry losses were incurred at Cassino, in the town and hills above it, as the Allies fought vainly to batter their way through heavily fortified positions to advance on Rome. What is not widely known is that a golden opportunity was created by Kiwi and Indian engineers to outflank Cassino through the construction of a road carved high up into the hills to the north of the German encampment. A surprise attack by 15 Kiwi Sherman tanks on 19 March saw the capture of Albaneta, a key German stronghold and supply line. As with Gallipoli 30 years earlier, however, the failings of army hierarchy let the Kiwi troops down as they were refused vital reinforcements and the result was defeat a few days later at the hands of hardened German paratroopers using hand-held weaponry. 

This book details the brilliant opportunity afforded by the Kiwi engineers, the surprise and success that resulted, and the inevitable failure. Based on eye-witness accounts on both sides, Freyberg's war diaries, minutes of Officers Conferences and formal reports, author Ron Crosby provides keen insight into a feat of Kiwi wartime bravery not previously written about.Maps and plenty of photographs complement the information as events unfold.

What is it that draws us back again and again to those special places that haunt our memory and are like a magnet to our soul? 

Perhaps partly because of its spectacular landscape, New Zealand has an abundance of such places.

 For author Bob Harvey it's Karekare Beach on Auckland's 'untamed coast'...

This glorious beach has attracted some of New Zealand's finest painters - Albrecht, Binney, Blomfield, Buchanan and Siddell. 

Writers like Curnow and Stead; filmmakers like Jane Campion, Barry Barclay and Niki Caro. 

The landcape is both magical and powerful, a magnet for photographers.

 This book reveals and celebrates their vision as seen in their art. Above all, this is a book about the people who came to this dramatic setting, where the western edge of New Zealand ends in a series of cliffs and steep-sided, narrow valleys and illustrates the history and natural environment of the beach, its pioneering characters, industry and surfing
tradition.

This comprehensive study blends geology, eyewitness accounts, and historical analysis. It’s considered the definitive scientific account of the eruption.
- Focus: Keam explored the eruption’s basaltic nature, its unusual characteristics within the Taupō Volcanic Zone, and the formation of the Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley.
- Legacy: His research helped clarify the fate of the Pink and White Terraces and contributed to conservation efforts in geothermal regions.


- Keam’s work bridged Māori oral histories and Western science, helping to preserve indigenous knowledge and deepen understanding of volcanic hazards.

There have been many published collections of soldiers' diaries and letters from the First World War, but never a first-hand account of one New Zealand family's life in England during these challenging and frightening years. 

When her sons, Oswald and Seton, decided they wanted to serve as pilots, which meant enlisting in Britain, Annie Montgomerie decreed that the whole family would go too. So from 1916 to 1919 they lived in London, facing Zeppelin attacks, giving hospitality to young New Zealand friends who left to fight (and sometimes never came back), watching Oswald and Seton go off to war, and suffering in the influenza epidemic. 

Through all this Annie kept a diary, in which she recorded her deep love and concern for her family, her hatred of the war, her forthright, amusing and proudly Kiwi views on the English and myriad fascinating details about wartime London life. 

Annie's granddaughter, Susanna Montgomerie Norris, has transcribed and edited this extraordinary account, along with many letters and diary excerpts from her pilot father, Seton. Richly illustrated with contemporary photographs and other memorabilia, Annie's War offers a unique and compelling view of a crucial time in world history.",FALSE,,TRUE,15.00,15.00,20.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Shipping  ....

Revealing the enormous tactical and military skill of Maori, and the inability of the ‘Victorian interpretation of racial conflict’ to acknowledge those qualities, Belich’s account of the New Zealand Wars offered a very different picture from the one previously given in historical works. 

Maori, in Belich’s view, won the Northern War and stalemated the British in the Taranaki War of 1860–61 only to be defeated by 18,000 British troops in the Waikato War of 1863–64. The secret of effective Maori resistance was an innovative military system, the modern pa, a trench-and-bunker fortification of a sophistication not achieved in Europe until 1915. 

According to the author: ‘The degree of Maori success in all four major wars is still underestimated – even to the point where, in the case of one war, the wrong side is said to have won.’

The Stone Store at Kerikeri, the Mission House at Waimate North and the Treaty House at Waitangi are obvious reminders of a vigorous and fruitful past, but there are also many ""hidden"" trails to fascinate residents and tourists alike. From the Bay of Islands and Hokianga Harbour to the farthest reaches of Ninety Mile Beach, the author points out where our ancestors trod and how they made history. He brings the landscape to life with tales from Maori traditions and of early European contact with the Colony. Impressions of gigantic kauri crashing to the ground and of thousands of fossicking gumseekers come easily.

There is no place quite like the Far North. The story of Pandora, an early 1900s hideaway and once described as ""the most beautiful place in the world"", contrasts sharply with the scene at Kororareka where Hone Heke and his followers felled the British flagpole no fewer than four times. Those who are willing to delve will find that every place has its tale, and no visitor to the Far North should be without this entertaining and invaluable guide.

The gang's ringleader, originally known as Richard Hill, had been transported from London to Melbourne for theft at the age of 16, arriving in 1847. After his release he resumed a life of crime and served several prison terms. By October 1861 he was calling himself Burgess, the name of a New South Wales runholder he had attempted to steal from. In January 1862 he left Australia for the Otago goldfields, where he again turned to crime, teaming up with Thomas Noon, an acquaintance from his prison days in Australia. Their specialty was attacking and robbing lone prospectors.

In March 1862 Sergeant-Major Bracken and members of the Otago Mounted Police attempted to bring Burgess and Noon in for questioning over a robbery at Weatherstones on the Otago goldfields. The pair escaped amid gunfire but were eventually captured. Despite their claims that Noon's gun had gone off accidentally, they received three and a half years' hard labour in Dunedin Gaol. Burgess was outraged at this sentence. He received 36 lashes for his role in an attempted escape while in prison and vowed to take revenge on society by taking a life for every lash he received. ....

Major Robert Adams Wilson DSO, the second son of a Rangitikei sheep farmer, was brought up in a privileged and cultured household.

 Inspired by his Scottish father, a Member of Parliament, and his Australian mother who was a noted writer, Bob had an enquiring and innovative mind, a firm belief in science and a love for literature and the arts. 

He was a keen polo player and a forward-thinking businessman whose interests in sawmilling culminated in the chairmanship of two of the North Island's most important timber companies. 

He successfully planted and farmed a large area of Himitangi coastal sand country, and he established the highly successful Mahoe Friesian Stud, but his greatest love was for the rugged and isolated places of New Zealand. 

For nearly four decades he went deerstalking in South Westland and Otago, and after serving in the British Army in World War One he encouraged English sportsmen to do the same.

 He was an authority on native birds, joining ornithologists Edgar Stead and Geoffrey Buddle on numerous research expeditions to New Zealand's most inhospitable offshore islands. 

He wrote for a variety of newspapers and journals, and he bred lilies and rhododendrons. A high mountain pass, an island bay, several native plants and a rare southern fernbird were named after him, yet he had no public profile and was little known outside his own circles. 

This book tells the story of a twentieth-century gentleman who lived on his own terms in the Rangitikei.

Phil Lightband’s soul has never left the sky since 1933 when, at the age of seven, he took his first flight—as a passenger with Charles Kingsford Smith in the Southern Cross, when his father paid for them both to take a ten-minute joyride with the famous aviator.

Gradually, Phil’s father began teaching the young boy to fly. At the age of 14, Phil made his first solo flight at New Plymouth—an event witnessed and celebrated by a supportive crowd of club members with whom the helpful and hard-working young Lightband had become very popular. It was 17 December 1939 and the world had been at war for three months

Four months later—while still only 15 years old—Phil was issued a private pilot’s licence by Air Force instructor Allan Crighton that recorded his age as 17

As soon as he was 18, Phil joined the RNZAF. During his training, he experienced the first of what would be many “close calls” in his flying career when another aircraft collided with his stationary Harvard and came within inches of taking his life. In a later crash, which Phil witnessed, one of his close friends lost his life in a spinning P40. Throughout Laurenson’s book, she describes Phil’s reflections on the “fate” that spared him while inexplicably taking others
Understandably, in light of his years of (secret) flying experience, Phil qualified as a fighter pilot and after training first in P40s, moved on to fly Corsairs in the Pacific at the end of 1944.

With the end of the war in the Pacific in August 1945, as Phil’ stint of combat came to an end, he experienced another fateful escape when a missing signature on his clearance papers prevented him from catching his scheduled flight home in a DC3. The DC3 he was supposed to take disappeared en route and was never seen again.",FALSE,,TRUE,20.00,20.00,25.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,5 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"7.00=well packed bubblewrapped Non Rural TRACKED;13.00=Rural Delivery RURAL;0.0=combined shipping Please email for postage quote;2.0=drop off Wanganui central, no rural drop off;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2024-05-05 09.05.13.jpg;2023-12-10 07.41.38.jpg;img20210125193837 (1).jpg;img20210125193845 (1).jpg;2023-12-10 07.41.58.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"2nd Week FEB 2 - FEB 9 2025",TRUE,FALSE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

 Basing his study on firsthand experience with Yukaghir hunters, Rane Willerslev focuses on the practical implications of living in a ""hall-of-mirrors"" world—one inhabited by humans, animals, and spirits, all of whom are understood to be endless mimetic doubles of one another. In this world human beings inhabit a betwixt-and-between state in which their souls are both substance and nonsubstance, both body and soul, both their own individual selves and reincarnated others. 

Hunters are thus both human and the animals they imitate, which forces them to steer a complicated course between the ability to transcend difference and the necessity of maintaining identity.

Joan Duett's Hen Frigates, Wives of Merchant Captains Under Sail is a fascinating and well researched book on the lives of women who went to sea with their husbands, Captains of sailing ships in the 19th century. 

Caught in the Victorian era the women were very restricted on what they could do (little besides sew, read, and take care of their children). They were isolated from the rest of the world aboard ship for months at a time and were often away from home for years at a time. 

Some of the women were timid as mice and others took change of the ships when their husbands were sick or died during a voyage. Or better yet, how many women would trust their husbands to deliver their child on a pitching ship at sea without a medical doctor in sight?

Joan Duett relied heavily upon the diaries and letters home written by ""sea sisters,"" so the book has a good feel of authenticity.

 Hen Frigates, even though it is very factual, is easy to read and a very insightful book.

This book explores the historical background of the All Blacks and the mystique that has grown around them.

 It examines what the jersey and, by association, the All Black status means to both players and public and even to opponents. 

Each chapter is accompanied by break-out vignettes quoting players on various aspects of All Blackdom - what it meant to them, how a few months (or even a few minutes) of fame in the All Black jersey shaped the rest of their lives, the sacrifices they made to be or to remain All Blacks, how they learned of their first selection or non-selection, and how devastated they were.

by Michael E. Uslan 

Is any superhero cooler than Batman? 

He s a crime-fighting vigilante with a tragic past, a lawless attitude, and a seemingly endless supply of high-tech gadgetry.

 In this fully illustrated memoir, author Michael Uslan recalls his journey from early childhood fandom through to the decades he spent on a caped crusade of his own: to bring Batman to the silver screen as the dark, serious character he was at heart. 

Uslan s story traces his path from the wilds of New Jersey to the limelight of Hollywood, following his work as Executive Producer on every Batman film from Tim Burton s 1989 re-envisioning to 2012 s The Dark Knight Rises. 

Through it all, he helped to create one of the most successful pop culture franchises of all time.

Central Otago, with its dramatic landscape and its climate extremes, provides a setting well suited to the story of human endeavour that preceded, and followed upon, the discovery of gold in its mountains, rivers and river terraces.
Before the gold miners came the explorers, men who performed prodigious physical feats, some in search of country for sheep and cattle, some for the joy of discovery itself. 

The Shotover, Skippers, Fox's secret valley, the Cardrona - these are the names to fire imagination of those who set out to travel the trails of the early gold seekers.

'Golden Days of Lake Country'. first issued in 1949, was one of the outstanding regional histories in the series published by the Otago Centennial Historical Committee.

21 Private Walking Tracks in New Zealand 

""New Zealand has an international reputation for the quality and range of its serious tramps. However, for a walking experience off the crowded public walking tracks, people are increasingly turning to the many private walks now operating throughout New Zealand, 25 of which are summarised in this comprehensive guide book.

 Although some of them are less demanding than the more renowned public tracks, all are serious overnight excursions and offer their own challenges while providing walkers with comforts not included on public tracks."" 


Ranging from Auckland's Great Barrier Island to the deep south's remote Caitlins, each of these walks involves at least two nights and two full days' tramping. Walter Hirsh furnishes the reader with every single trail including: 

- level of difficulty 
- track capacity and season 
- catering arrangements, varying from basic through to luxurious 
- full contact details and plenty more besides

This is an informal, unorthodox and highly diverting biography of the major New Zealand poet, wit and social commentator

Rex Fairburn (1904-57). James and Helen McNeish have crafted a lively portrait of this exuberant Aucklander through the careful but inspired juxtaposition of oral, visual and written material. The resulting picture is of a man larger than life, set against a kaleidoscope of events, some laughable, some serious, drawn from an era of importance in New Zealand's social and cultural history. 

This biography ensures that the man, the era and the generation he represents, will never be lost. 

The book is enhanced by the illustrative material the biographers have assembled: sketches, portraits and paintings by professionals in Fairburn's circle and by the writer himself; reproductions from many of the flamboyantly presented satires Fairburn had published by the small presses of the Thirties and Forties; doodles, limericks, drawings and photographs from family albums, friends files and the archives of various New Zealand institutions.

by Lew Lind

When in January 1988 the lofty silhouettes of a fleet of tall ships ghosted their way through the early morning sun of Sydney Heads, they were paying homage to that great concourse of sailing vessels which has spanned two centuries of Australia's history.

Once more the wharfs and berths became familiar with the subtle differences of full-rigged ships, barques, barquentines, brigs, brigantines, schooners, topsail schooners and cutters. And the raising and lowering of square sails, staysails, spankers and topsails.

A long dead vocabulary was resurrected with terms like bowsprits, dolphin strikers, figureheads, halyards, Cape Horn fever, deadlights, fids, chippies, peggies, dodgers, scuppers and warps. The year of the Tall Ships, as much as any other aspect of the Bicentenary, brought home the seafaring origins of the nation.

This is a pictorial history of 200 years of sail on the Australia station. The author recounts the founding and the voyage of Captain Phillip's first fleet as the start of a long line of Royal Navy and Colonial Navy ships. He continues through to the Antarctic research vessel HMAS Wyatt Earp, as the last commissioned ship of the Royal Australian Navy to carry sail.

Owen Gatman's letters home provide a first-person perspective on how his initial feelings of adventure and excitement were ground down by boring routine, barely sufferable climatic conditions and the realities and horrors of modern warfare. Amazingly, despite everything he experienced, Owen still managed to retain his faith in the basic goodness of human nature and an ability to see beauty amidst the trials of battle.

The Drivers is the first in a fascinating
series of books that capture the
remarkable legacy of New Zealand
motor sports' past, and indeed its
future, by looking at the individual

drivers on four wheels that made New
Zealand famous all over the world.
In a tiny country with limited

resources it is all the more amazing
that New Zealand has such a richness
of history in the global motor-racing
arena. Names like Mclaren, Hulme,

Amon, Murphy and Dixon and up-and-
coming drivers like Jonny Reid and
Matt Halliday have made an impression
on the media at home and overseas.

Many other highly skilled drivers
have made international history yet
barely created a ripple in their home
country's psyche.

The Drivers celebrates the contribution
of Kiwi racers' exploits to New
Zealand's outstanding reputation in
international motor sport from the
early 1920s to the present day.


McLaren, Hulme and Amon have risen above the radar in New Zealand with colourful tales of skill, success, daring and disaster. 

To have merely competed overseas, let alone excelled at any level in motor sport, is to have achieved something beyond our local comprehension. In New Zealand, motor racing is fun, and expensive.

 Overseas, it is deadly serious, expensive beyond our grasp and hugely competitive. Greg Murphy, the best known driver in New Zealand today, is one of many Kiwis whose name has been on the lips of millions outside Australasia, in America and Europe. 
 These include: Chris Amon, Craig Baird, Scott Dixon, Denny Hulme, Bruce McLaren, David Oxton, Aaron Slight, Paul Radisich, Greg Murphy, Mike Thackwell, etc, etc.

His first book Something to Roar About was a complete sellout success, now he once again takes the reader along on some of his more memorable trips.

Success is not always measured by meat or fish on the table. Friendships made, the camaraderie of the hunt and the joy of being out in the back blocks of New Zealand and Australia, just having fun, is what it is all about.

Although retired and confessing to slowing down a little, Graham manages more hunting than many a fraction of his age. 

With the ability of a natural storyteller and a bush poet this latest collection of yarns is sure to win even more fans than his first book.

From mashers to milk bars, flappers to factory girls, larrikins to louts – this intimate and evocative look at youth culture offers insights into the true lives of teenagers and the history of New Zealand.
Teenagers is a ground-breaking history of young people in New Zealand from the nineteenth century to the 1960s. Through the diaries and letters, photographs and drawings that teenagers left behind, we meet New Zealanders as they transition from children to adults: sealers and bushfellers, factory girls and newspaper boys, the male ‘mashers’ of the 1880s and the female  ‘flappers’ of the 1910s and ’20s, schoolgirls and rock’n’rollers, larrikins and louts.

By taking us inside the lives of young New Zealanders, the book illuminates from a new angle large-scale changes in our society: the rise and fall of domestic service, the impact of compulsory education, the movement of Pakeha and then Maori from country to city, the rise of consumer culture and popular psychology. Teenagers shows us how young people made sense of their personal and social transformations: in language and song and dress, at dances and picnics and social clubs, in talking and playing and reading.

Teenagers provides an intimate and evocative insight into the lives of young people and the history of New Zealand.

Hopes were high for the prosperity of the Normandale Settlement in 1903. In theory it had everything going for it and recent settlements at Korokoro had been quite successful. Normandale would be close to the Hutt township and only a few minutes' walk from the Lower Hutt Railway Station. It was expected that lessees would continue to work at their jobs in the Hutt or Wellington but be able to make some extra income off the land.

However, like the first European settlement of the area last century, interest in even the sections of a few acres was disappointing and in 1909 a newspaper columnist described Normandale as a ""Heartbreak Settlement"" of bleak desolation and ruin.

A Hutt resident responded that the reason for the lack of success was due to most of the residents having a basic lack of understanding of anything to do with agriculture. Most, he said. prior to coming to New Zealand had never had the opportunity to get out of the sight of a factory chimney, or the sound of its bell.

Fortunately, those who took up larger areas of land had better success with farming. But it was a great place for the children to grow up. Apart from the usual chores there was plenty of fun- picnics at the Korokoro Dam, mush rooming on the large farms further up Normandale Road, glowworms on the banks above Normandale Road, and dances at the old school. 

This book is their story. In the 1950s amalgamation with Lower Hutt City saw modern services come to the area, enabling landowners to subdivide their properties, paving the way for the attractive suburb we know today, some 600 homes in peaceful, bushclad surroundings with views over Wellington Harbour

 Anyone with an interest in pioneering skills and their development into a modern creative industry will find this book a fascinating story of endeavor

Readers with a collector's interest in early New Zealand ceramics - and there is a growing collectors' market for early New Zealand wares - will find this an invaluable resource for identifying their finds, be they pickle jars, teapots, or ducks flying up a wall. 

There are few households in New Zealand today which do not boast in the kitchen or living room some small example of the wares of an earlier era in the history of ceramics in this country.

 Yet how many know of the hundred years or more of endeavor by which pioneer craftsmen, isolated from the familiar materials and markets of their homeland, struggled to establish what is today a major manufacturing industry. 

Drawing largely on oral accounts of this time of determination, initiative and drive, the author has rescued from oblivion not only examples of most of these early wares, but also the stories of the men who shaped them.

The collieries and heavy industry, on which the town's prosperity was built, proved fertile ground in which talented musicians were to gather together and develop the skills of their neighbours and workmates.

 They formed bands to entertain themselves and others, to compete with the peers and to lend tone and rich colour to community activities. Eric Jessop calls upon the history of his own family and of Dodworth, the place in which he has always lived, to tell a wider story of the manner in which the brass band tradition has enriched and still enriches the social and cultural life of the Barnsley area. 

He shares experience and anecdotes, recalls humour and alcoholic excesses and provides wise counsel on the means of promoting the movement to a new and younger generation of potential performers. The book includes brief histories of many local bands and is lavishly illustrated with archive photographs and pictures.

Despite his political achievements 'The Master' was unsociable, close-fisted and chauvanistic. In tracing the story of John Davies Ormond and his wife Hannah Richardson, the author has revealed much about the politics, land dealings and social life of the 1800s. 

Ormond was the last Superintendent of Hawke's Bay, a Member of the House of Representatives and of the Legislative Council. This eminently readable biography will be treasured by historians and general readers alike, especially those living in, or associated with, the Hawke's Bay area.

Considered New Zealand's most significant poet, James K. Baxter has also been called one of the most remarkable English-language poets of the mid-twentieth century. Born into an educated family in New Zealand, he spent most of his life there and became a much-loved and respected figure in his homeland. Starting out as something of a boy prodigy in the field of poetry, Baxter went on to face alcoholism, then to convert to Catholicism. In his last years, some considered him a saint as he wandered around New Zealand ""barefoot, long-bearded, patched and baggy."" Baxter published his first poetry in 1944. He also wrote about 20 plays-many of them produced successfully-four books of literary commentary and criticism, numerous religious essays, and fiction. His Collected Poems is still available, but most of his work in other genres is out of print. Collected Poems won a 2016 Publishers Association of New Zealand (PANZ) Book Design Awards, Gerard Reid Award for best book and Best non-illustrated book (designed by Spencer Levine and Fergus Barrowman). Believing strongly in the poet's vocation, in the poet as a prophet, Baxter was also a skilled artist. His work, which is characterized by a technical conservatism and an adherence to formality, reflects his familiarity with a wide range of poets, including the English romantics, Greek and Latin poets, and modernists, such as Yeats, Hopkins, and Hardy.",FALSE,,TRUE,15.00,15.00,,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,5 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Shipping  ....

""Nowhere are New Zealand's scenic attractions seen in greater diversity than in the Provincial District of Nelson.

 In this north-western corner of the South Island nature has been lavish in her widely differing gifts. Here may be found the beauty of river and lake; the majesty of mountain and forest; blue sea and yellow sandy beaches.

 Nelson, too, is steeped in historical interest, and has witnessed some of New Zealand's most daring and sensational feats of exploration. And for good measure Nelsons share of sunshine is the envy of many other parts of the country""

This is a highly readable collection of stories from the lives of five remarkable people. It is full of yarns and anecdotes, recreating the tough and demanding life which was lived on farms and in the backblocks in many parts of the country in the earlier years of the century.

Here are men and women who literally turned their hands to anything and everything, who relied on themselves and picked themselves up and tried again after knock backs – with humour, courage and downright Kiwi ingenuity. From desperate adventures and life and death backblocks medicine to the reminders of everyday life with none of today’s amenities, here is “New Zealand as she was”, sharply and lovingly remembered.

Work on the site commenced in January 1863, making it the first Botanic Garden to be established in New Zealand.

 The Story of the Dunedin Botanic Garden explores the turbulent early years of establishment, the vagaries of its administration and the contribution of its gardeners and curators over those 140 years. The removal of the Garden to its present location in 1869 opened the way for the development of a series of quality plant collections in an environment of great beauty.

 Public interest in and support for the Garden has always been strong, and this has sometimes led to criticism and controversy.

 Here the author examines the issues and personalities involved. The year 2003 is also significant in that it marks the 100th anniversary of the arrival of David Tannock, the first Superintendent of Parks and Reserves, a major figure in the development of the Garden. Not only was his influence and impact on the shape of the Garden extensive, but his contribution to horticulture and public gardens throughout New Zealand was outstanding. The book is extensively illustrated throughout with both historical and contemporary photographs, reminding us of the importance of the Garden for the people of Dunedin.

A tiny outpost of colonial administration is planted on the desolate mudflats of King Sound, at Derby. 

Leases are marked on a map covering huge areas, and the push into the north begins. Vast herds of cattle and sheep move across the land and with it, a new future. In the remote Kimberley, in the late nineteenth century, on the ancient lands of the Bunuba, the last stages of an invasion are about to be played out.

 Amidst the ensuing chaos and turmoil, extraordinary relationships grow. The thrilling story of the great warrior, Jandamarra, who turned from police assistant to resistance fighter. Thought to be unstoppable, he led the Bunuba against the forces invading their land. 

A legend, forever etched into the history of the Kimberley, Jandamarra's courage and fighting spirit made him one of the region's most wanted men. Jandamarra and the Bunuba Resistance is a grand story with a grand theme. A powerful collaboration between a non-Indigenous historian and the Indigenous custodian of the Jandamarra story.

Kinloch, at the head of Lake Wakatipu, has its own charm, its own pull on all who have lived there or passed through it as the starting point for the majestic Routeburn Valley.

This northwest corner of the Wakatipu country, although isolated, has been settled for many years. And through the checkered pattern of the whole period runs the thread of the activities of the Bryant family. From the original Richard Bryant, first harbour master of Lake Wakatipu in 1864 and founder of Kinloch Hotel, to the present generation and the famous bus service, the Bryants have been part of Kinloch. This book brings them to life, as well as the sawmillers, the musterers, the tourists - even the rustlers.

 The essential guide for the ride of your life. A bike ride that began with 26 friends in 1977 is today New Zealand's premier cycling event. Covering a scenic course on 160 kilometres of sealed road around beautiful Lake Taupo, it caters for riders of all abilities, and attracts around 12,000 riders, with numbers increasing every year. In 2007 it was named one of the best rides in the world by the International Cycling Union, and became part of the prestigious international UCI Golden Bike series.

 The most popular challenge is the solo ride around the lake, but there are also 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-person relays, a 5-kilometre ride for children, and 2- and 4-lap endurance rides. Elite riders compete in the Avanti Classic. Whether you're riding for fun or competitively, this book contains all the information you'll need to prepare for the event and have a great ride on the day - including details of the course, suggestions as to gear, and training programmes for all levels.

 Though his name remains relatively unknown, millions of Australians are still familiar with Stitt's drawings and animated films, most of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s. Stitt has created Australian icons like Norm of ‘Life. Be in it'; Hector the Cat, who taught road safety rules to school children; ICPOTA, who encouraged the use of the classified pages of the Age, and Sid, the lisping, dancing seagull from ‘Slip, Slop, Slap' for the Cancer Council. Stitt's virtuosity is the stuff of legend among his family, friends, colleagues, clients and associates.

 He singlehandedly produced some of the first televisions commercials ever seen in Australia before he turned 20. Stitt Autobiographics started as a digital assembly of work produced over Alexander Stitt's 50-year career as a graphic designer and evolved into a personal account of how, why and for whom the work happened, who helped and how it all worked out. The book includes more than 1800 illustrations, as well as pages of comic strips and whole small books, storyboards and film title frames. It has some terrible flops as well as some fabulous success stories. Like most of what Alex Stitt creates, the book is a oneoff original.

Antarctica is one of the least explored and least known parts of the world, and from the beginning New Zealanders have been at the cutting edge of exploration and research.   

Even before the establishment of Scott Base in 1957, New Zealand was the launching pad for many forays into this unforgiving but beautiful continent.   

Our official presence in Antarctica began fifty years ago, and since that time thousands of men and women have made the trip south and contributed to our understanding of this unique environment and its impact on our world.   This book is a fitting tribute and celebration of their achievements.

Wearing the colour red, living by the 'law of lawnessness' and having the patch with the emblem of the mighty bulldog on your back was what ex-Mongrel Mob leader Tuhoe 'Bruno' Isaac called being True Red. ""Because all levels of society hated us we created a new society of hatred symbolised by the bulldog. Its ferocious habits were engraved on our hearts,"" Tuhoe says, ""If you weren't a mobster you weren't worth knowing."" He lived this way for 17 years.

However, constantly living for the bash, beer, prison and the possibility of dying in a pool of blood eventually saw Tuhoe search for another way of doing life. Leaving the Mob was hard. Not only did he face the rejection of his own and the fierce judgemental prejudices of mainstream society, but with the awakening of his conscience came the realisation of a past filled with inflicting pain on others besides himself, and of a life devoid of any sense of love or hope. This led him down a path of confession, forgiveness and reconciliation.

Europeans settlers achieved the same feat in less than 200 years with the introduction of numerous predatory mammals and herbivores to compete with and destroyed the weak-winged birds, reptiles, snails and insects. Rare and endanged species or subspecies of New Zealand have been vividly recorded here by Noel Cusa's paintings in full colour.

The highly talented Gareth Shute returns with what will be a seminal book on the history of guitar music in this country.

The book begins in 1987 at the point where Crowded House's track 'Don't Dream it's Over' had just reached the top of the singles charts in the United States. It traces the history of guitar music in NZ from this time until the present, showing how local bands have tried to follow this example or have sought different routes to success - either locally or internationally.

A French peasant, Jeanne Baret, was the first woman known to have circumnavigated the globe. She did this by assuming the guise of a man on a voyage to the Pacific led by Louis de Bougainville in 1766. Monsieur Baret is the first book in English about this remarkable woman.
Baret was the housekeeper and lover of botanist Philibert Commerson, and when he was chosen as the expedition's naturalist, she accompanied him as his servant, keeping her identity hidden from all but Commerson for several months. Although it appears the crew speculated about Baret's gender, it was not until they reached the Pacific that her true identity was revealed – by a Tahitian who, in an ironic twist, may have actually thought she was a male transvestite.
John Dunmore, a New Zealander who has written several other books on European explorers in the Pacific, has ably reconstructed the period. He outlines the historical context, and details life on board an eighteenth century sailing ship: the cramped conditions, rats, dwindling supplies, scurvy. He has been assiduous in his research; the book includes diary excerpts, footnotes, an index and bibliography.
Monsieur Baret highlights the life of a brave and determined woman who took on the tasks of a man, and proved herself capable of demanding physical labour. She was invaluable in assisting Commerson as his 'beast of burden' in collecting botanical specimens, and also in organising his collection and papers, of which he was notoriously neglectful.

Providing a rare female perspective on life in colonial Canterbury, New Zealand, this collection of letters--from four middle-class women to their families in Britain presents a picture of daily colonial life. 

Though separated by distance and the long wait for post, the women of the Hall family sought to remain close to Britain while life in their new province took form. 

The collected letters focus on children, household duties, health, housing and servants, church, shopping, and social events.

 Preceding the annotated transcriptions of the letters is an enlightening introduction to the Hall family, which places them and the correspondence in an appropriate historical context that will appeal to history enthusiasts and casual readers alike.

When I set off to cycle the New Zealand coastline, I was hoping for two things: an unforgettable adventure & to raise some cash for St John New Zealand. I never in my wildest dreams thought I’d turn the people, stories & scenery I encountered into a book… Not a proper, real, published book!

Well, after much work, belief & a few setbacks, it’s happening. Last year, something incredible happened: David Bateman Publishing picked up my draft chapters and together we’re stoked to bring this story to you.

The final changes have been polished off… and The Big Loop will be available to buy from early October.

This is not a guide, it’s the candid account of what happened out there… the easy days, the struggles, what nearly broke me and, most importantly, the people who carried me round. It also has photos and some all-important maps.

British author Forty, well known for his work on armored warfare and his illustrated campaign histories, illuminates the experience of tank warfare through interviews, personal communications and oral histories from American, British, French, German and Soviet soldiers. The men recall everything from enlistment (or draft) through training to combat and its aftermath. 

Whatever the army, the experiences were similar. British, Russian or American, a tank crewman's war was structured by the requirements of driving, maintaining and utilizing a complex, fragile weapons system. An individual's mistake or a failure of teamwork, an overheated engine or a jammed turret, could prove fatal. 

Foot soldiers envied the tankers: not only did tank crews ride everywhere and go into battle sheltered by armor, but they were able to carry such luxuries as stoves or extra blankets in their vehicles. Forty's narrators, however, make it abundantly clear that armor plating could seem paper-thin under the muzzle of a German 88 or a British 17-pounder.

 With fighter-bombers overhead, even a Tiger tank was no more than a large, slow target. Nicknames like ""Zippos"" or ""Tommy cookers"" paid grim tribute to the flammability of damaged tanks. In particular, Forty's chapter on casualties, with its repeated, matter-of-fact descriptions of crews reduced to ash or burned alive, offers harrowing testimony to the fact that no one in combat has an easy war.

 Newton writes as a South Island sheep man but he is no stranger. Blended with the history of each station are warm and humerous anecdotes of cooks and cattlemen, wild horses and working dogs.

The Journal of Henry Sewell 1853-7, Volume II May 1854 - May 1857 Edited by W. David McIntyre. 

This second volume of Henry Sewell's Journal, 1853-7, deals mainly with his experiences as a parliamentarian in Auckland, though there are excursions back to Canterbury to witness the final completion of his salvage operation on the accounts of the Canterbury Association. 

Away from politics (and Auckland), the chief highlight of Volume II is a full-length description of a sheep drove down across the Canterbury Plains as far as Timaru, featuring hazardous river-crossings and comments on early station life. 

And there is another diversion to Akaroa, during which the diarist meets the famous cadet runholders Tripp and Acland and shares their exploration of Banks Peninsula.

In December 1941, Japan attacked the British Commonwealth and the United States. 

For a few desperate months during early 1942, New Zealand faced down the threat of a blockade and, ultimately, invasion. Despite a heavy commitment to the European war, New Zealanders eventually fought the Japanese on land, sea and air, from Malaya to the Solomons and, finally, in Japanese home waters. 

New Zealand also provided bases and recreation facilities for US forces, food for the whole campaign, and even physicists for the atomic bomb project. This remarkable effort had to be balanced against the demands of a European war to which New Zealand was also making a substantial contribution, and New Zealand's land forces were withdrawn from the Pacific in 1944 after manpower shortages reached crisis point - an issue that soon became entwined with Pacific politics.

 In 'Pacific War', Matthew Wright recounts the story of New Zealand's Pacific struggle, focusing particularly on the politics of war and the short-lived army contribution to the Pacific Islands. Diaries and letters from the front, some previously unpublished, help bring New Zealand's war experience alive

"PR1375",,1.0000,FALSE,1820,,"Lieutenant Commander William Edward Sanders VC Naval Hero",,"Naval historian Grant Howard spent five years researching and writing about war hero Lieutenant Commander William Edward Sanders.

The only New Zealand naval officer to ever win the Victoria Cross.

""It took five years to finish this book because for one, very little is known about this man and very little was written about what he had done,"" Mr Howard, 80, says.

Mr Sanders was born on February 7, 1883, in Kingsland and originally worked for a well known Queen St firm from the age of 14.

The job was organised through his parents but the youngster had other plans.

""Every lunch hour and every opportunity he got, young Sanders could be found down on the Auckland waterfront looking over the ships at port,"" Mr Howard says.

""There he would chat with the crews of the various coastal steamers and sailing ships, listening to their stories, and dreaming of going to sea himself.""

Mr Sanders got his chance two years later when, while on a family holiday on Waiheke Island, he found the merchant ship Kapanui had a vacancy for a cabin boy.

He got the job and volunteered for the navy after the outbreak of World War One.

His application was not accepted and he instead signed up for troopship duties on HMNZT Willochra and later on HMNZT Tofua, taking New Zealand soldiers to the Middle East and bringing wounded men home.

He again volunteered and was made a Temporary Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserves. He then volunteered for special service and joined one of Britain's many attempts to combat the German U-boat assault on merchant shipping.

Navy public relations manager Lieutenant Commander Barbara Cassin says Mr Sanders holds a unique place in New Zealand's maritime history.

His ship, the HMS Prize, was attacked by a German U-boat in April 1917. Mr Sanders hoisted the navy ensign as the enemy craft approached and opened fire, severely crippling it. He died four months later in another attack.

A large and important slab of New Zealand history is told here from a new angle. The maritime industry, on which our island nation has always been vitally dependent, is seen from the point of view of the men working on the decks and down in the stockholds of our ships. 

The story of their industrial organisation is a saga of struggle. Just as they have struggled often enough against the elements for survival, they have also had to struggle against the shipowners for every improvement in wages and conditions. The tough and colourful figures who have led the Seamen's Union in these struggles, -- Millar, Belcher, Young, Walsh -- have all been significant figures in New Zealand politics.

 Besides giving a frank account of the little-known parts played by these men in our nation's history, the book gives revealing glimpses of Premiers Seddon, Massey, Fraser and Holyoake in the unguarded moments of power

 Such accounts are rare because it was against military law for any soldier to keep a diary of activity at the Front, lest it fall into enemy hands.

 Monty's diary gives the reader a direct sense of life at the Front where every breath may well be the writer's last. As an ANZAC diary, it provides one of the few detailed accounts of the experiences of Passchendaele. The 3rd Battle of Ypres cost Australia and New Zealand more lives than any other military engagement in their short histories. 

To this day, there has been no disaster greater than Passchendaele to befall these nations. The diary also provides the reader with a rare first hand account of New Zealand's most successful moment of WWI - the liberation of the fortified town of Le Quesnoy in France.

A valuable memoir from an era which shaped New Zealand, Lindsay Good's story stands out as much for his frank description of the less glamorous aspects of a soldier's training and camp life, as for his vivid account of combat and its aftermath. Colourful, humorous and wise, Mussolini, Bella Maria & Tojo captures the spirit of the ordinary Kiwi soldier in extraordinary times.

In the late 1990s Bill Leadley's granddaughter, Jan Chamberlin, spent many months researching her family archives in order to be able to put her grandfather's diary covering the ANZAC landing on Gallipoli in context. 

Shrapnel & Semaphore is the result and it is an amazing story of courage, faith and service based on a series of diary entries written by Lance-Corporal Walter Edmund (Bill) Leadley covering the period 25 April 1915 through to 8 December, and from 25 March 1916 to 9 September prior to serving at The Somme where he was seriously wounded and invalided out. 

The fascinating and frequently harrowing narrative is supported by family and archive photographs. Soon after his return to New Zealand in 1917, Bill Leadley became involved in the Canterbury Returned Soldiers' Association and went on to invest an enormous amount of time and effort over the next 25 years - on both a professional and personal basis - helping to rehabilitate injured fellow servicemen. In a subsequent chapter to the diaries themselves Jan Chamberlin records his dedication to the RSA.

Poignant YA historical romance between a teen who runs away to fight in World War One, and his sweetheart back at home.

Poignant YA historical romance between a teen who runs away to fight in World War One, and his sweetheart back at home.

Harry Wainwright is 17, not quite 18, but he can't wait to enlist for the Great War - so instead of going back to boarding school he runs away to war.

He does this with the help of his sweetheart, Jessica. They are a wholesome Edwardian couple, steeped in all the respectable morality of their age. Both are in love with romance.

Their letters begin idealistically and enthusiastically but gradually both young people learn of the horror of war and its associated cynicism. Rather than a depressing read, this is an interesting chronicle of the times and a charming portrayal of innocent love.

This jointly-written history is the culmination of five years work and marks the contribution of countless New Zealanders to the cause of aviation, both military and civil, at home and abroad, and both in the air and on the ground. 

Their combined achievements have made the writing of this book possible. It is a general text on New Zealand aviation, and is aimed not just at those with a passing interest in the subject in the hope that it will stimulate them further. 

The idea of compiling a joint civil-military history of New Zealand aviation first arose in the late 1970s, at a time when New Zealand aviation seemed to becoming apart at the seams. Our concern at this development was one of the main reasons for pressing ahead with what turned out to be a massive project. Other reasons were that from an early age we both had become very interested in flying and in aircraft of all kinds and wished to share this interest.

 A genuine and careful effort has been made to put events of the past, both good and bad and in true perspective, and to account for the present in a way that will, hopefully, prevent the mistakes of the past from being made again.

A stark and moving account of the profoundly different experiences of his grandfather and great-uncle at Gallipoli. 

Hedley Kitchin, his great-uncle, took part in the Gallipoli landing and was promptly killed on the morning of 25 April 1915.
 
His letters and diaries written during the months prior to Gallipoli evoke the doomed purposefulness and excitement surrounding the preparations for that disastrous campaign.

A direct account of two Anzac stories - one encapsulating the Anzac legend in abrupt, tragic detail, the other exploring much less familiar themes, of survival, brutalization, despondency and overcoming. 

Throughout the book are vignettes of heroism and futility, casting light on this most remarkable episode in modern Australian history. This book is intended for students of military history and of Commonwealth history

Andy Lyver was your average chick with a perfectly normal life until she discovered pig hunting - and now she’s gone to the dogs. With a row of kennels in the backyard and more canine friends than girlfriends, these days she’s practically feral, roaming the hills as often as she can.
Luckily, Andy’s better half Maco didn’t throw her out along with those first two pups she brought home in 2004 – and together they learnt as they went along. This is not your usual pig hunting book. There are no ‘two hundy’ boars, no ‘wonder dogs’ and no ‘super hunters’; just a couple of unlikely late starters making up for lost time and having the best of kiwi adventures.

And as you read it, you’ll agree that it’s not about the pigs – well, not entirely. It’s just as much about the dogs - breeding them, training them - and especially hunting with them. Join Andy as she shares her passion for pig hunting. Actually, it’s more than that. She realised it was serious the day she skipped a staff Christmas party when a farmer called, wanting instant action on some pigs he’d seen in his paddock. Someone had to do it....

In New Zealand the twenty years or so immediately preceding 1840 span the movement from orality, through manuscript literacy, to the introduction of printing. In a minor way therefore they replicate in a specific and largely quantifiable context the Gutenberg revolution in fifteenth-century Europe. 

In that New Zealand context one significant document, the Treaty of Waitangi, witnesses to a quite remarkable moment in the contact between representatives of a literate European culture and those of a wholly oral indigenous one. 

It can be used as a test case for measuring the impact of literacy and the influence of print in the 1830s; and it offers a prime example of European assumptions about the comprehension, status, and binding power of written statements and written consent on the one hand as against the flexible accommodations of oral consensus on the other. Its variant versions, its range of ‘signatures’, and the conflicting views of its meaning and status bring all those questions sharply into focus. Conversely, a fuller understanding of the conditions of orality and literacy at the time it was signed may help to define more accurately the ways in which the treaty might now be reconstructed, interpreted, and applied.

From the cities, towns, and countryside of New Zealand they came, in answer to Englands call. There were farmers, labourers, and rail waymen, bushmen and Jacks of all trades. They were single. married, old and young. They were fathers, and uncles, brothers and sons from many different social and cultural back grounds. The visionaries were saying that this war would be over, in a matter of months. How right they were, for in a matter of months during the Gallipoli Campaign, so many would find that they would bleed the same colour blood, suffer disease, lose various limbs and die, side by side The survivors of this defeat would regroup, think much, say little. and many of them would go on to fight and die on the Western Front

Years are only a matter of months after all.

Comparisons of the South Sea islands as they were during Captain James Cook's 3 voyages of discovery and as they are today.


Roderick Cameron visited Tahiti, Easter Island, Tonga, the Marquesas, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia and Hawaii between 1959 and 1961. It was a matter of flying to the main island of each archipelago and then arranging his itinerary. 

For instance to explore the New Hebrides he had to charter a fifty-foot launch, and to visit the Isle of Pines in New Caledonia he hired a Puss Moth.

His book devotes a chapter to each area, summarising what happened there when Cook arrived and then when Cameron arrived.

An hour later, the flagship and Monmouth had gone down with all hands, Glasgow had only narrowly escaped the same fate. The Battle of Coronel was over...

At the beginning of the Second World War, after a rather surprising interlude as, in rapid succession, convoy commander, civilian spy, 'degausser' and commodore commanding a synthetic squadron, Hickling took command of the new cruiser Glasgow. 

He soon saw action in the Mediterranean, in the hunt for the German pocket-battleship Admiral Scheer, and as Naval Officer in charge of the British Mulberry Harbour at Arromanches...

Nearly Out of Heart & Hope is a challenging work at the forefront of contemporary historical enquiry and certain to create the same interest and debate as Fairburn's earlier book, The Ideal Society and its Enemies 

Cox's diary is a rare record of the daily life of a permanent member of the colonial working class - nothing like it exists in a New Zealand archive and little elsewhere. 

Rather than reproducing selections of the somewhat down-to-earth diary entries, Fairburn uses it more interestingly, taking the life of this obscure and unimportant man to explore in novel and ambitious ways some issues in writing and understanding nineteenth-century New Zealand history, colonial societies and working-class experience. 

A vivid biographical account of Cox's harsh and stressful life is followed by a reconstruction of his material world and his world of beliefs and ideas. Fairburn shows characteristic brilliance and innovation in his analysis of why in spite of a profound commitment to the work ethic Cox gradually slid further and further into poverty and why his own misfortunes never led him to question his belief in self-help.

This book, specially written for the Palmerston North Centennial Celebrations, based on living memory, is a valuable social document as well as an entertaining story. 

Here is the story of the eight families who between 1880 and 1908, founded the farms and homesteads that have become part of Massey University. Isolated from Palmerston North by the Manawatu River and by what then seemed a considerable distance, they formed a community; their stories interlock.

The man were men of standing, the women had character. Most of the families belonged to a privileged set, wealthy and well connected; and, astonishingly in view of New Zealand's stern pioneer tradition, lived a New Zealand version of the life of the Victorian squirearchy.
Two of the families, by contrast, were founded by self made men, no less proud than their privileged neighbours., who carved out their respected place in the community as they carved out the farms that were their livelihood - by hard work and the exercise of their native intelligence.

this valuable addition to NZ's aviation literature tells of the courageous attempt by SPANZ to break the shackles of the Government-owned monopoly on air travel in the country. 

Innovative as well as adventurous SPANZ provided links to provincial centers formerly either largely ignored or poorly served. 

The new venture proved popular with small investors and was also supported by the Australian airline Ansett. Although the airline grew to fly to 21 cities and towns and was popular with patrons the end came in 1966 when the company went into receivership, after five years of operations.

 Richard Waugh has recorded much of NZ's aviation history in the books he has compiled and edited, of which SPANZ was the sixth and one of the most important. First edition of 2000, 148 pages, illustrated with 12 colour photographs, with b/w photographs, maps, documents and cartoons throughout.

Hardcover good ++++ condition

Pat Lawlor’s Old Wellington Hotels covers a field much wider than its title suggests. 

Apart from giving a lively history of over one hundred hotels the author paints the social pattern of times in vivid colours. 

After all many of the important movements of the earlydays he tells of, whether these movements were political or social, origiin the licensed houses of the period

 The book is crammed with anecdote and with personalities. The pictures alone reveal many interesting aspects of the city and environs although the point of interest is the hotel depicting Forgotten aspects of streets and oId buildings then standing are revealed in this respect each of the 100 or so photographs has been carefully selected In between times the story revealing
interesting aspects of the licensing over the years and the many changes that took place. The terrific battles between the “Drys” and the “Wet's show up from time to time and mention is made of some of those who play a leading part in the triennial contests In this connection the pictures show many hotels that lost their licenses the local option polls.

Altogether Mr Lawlor’s story is dry historical record, nor is it of in only to frequenters of hotels, even No License people will be interested what he has to reveal.

Professor Barratt, a specialist on Russian history, has examined New Zealand archives and uncovered a mixture of comedies of errors, and of deft attempts by the New Zealand Government to use the threat of Russian expansion in the Pacific as a leaver to obtain financial assistance from Great Britain. 

Editorials. letters, reports, cartoons even, have been used for this picture of a serio-comic episode in the history of the South Pacific. At the same time, it is a scholarly contribution to the emerging history of the Pacific basin as a whole

'Where The Waves Fall' makes use of this approach to give a unique account of human settlement and cultural interchange in the Pacific islands.  It follows the fortunes of the seafarers who discovered island after island in the world's largest ocean, traces the development of their civilisations and examines in depth the interaction between them and the newcomers - European explorers, traders, beachcombers, missionaries, merchants - who from the sixteenth century came in an increasing series of waves 'upon the coral ringed shores of the South Seas'.

The book's framework often enables the author to throw new light on hitherto isolated events. 

 Novel suggestions are advanced as to why some islands became 'kingdoms' in the earlier years of European contact and why others did not, and of how and why missionaries were accepted on some islands but not on others.  Nor does Dr Howe shrink from provocative and at times controversial arguments concerning the ambitions and strategies of island leaders and indeed the overall nature and extent of the initiatives taken by the Islanders.

This is a survey of human history in the Pacific islands, from the beginnings of recorded time until the present day. To tell the story of humankind across the great expanse of the Pacific is a daunting task. This book considers how indigenous societies came to be established and the tales that native people told of that history. 

It goes on to describe their attempts to incorporate and then come to terms with Western influence. 

This book is designed to be of interest to undergraduate students of history and anthropology.

  Planes were rarely seen above the small Central Otago sheep-farming town of Ranfurly in the 1940s. Yet as a young boy, Tom Enright had a fascination with the skies that quickly developed into a longing to become a pilot. He joined the RNZAF as an engineer in 1951, and was sent to England at just 16 to attend the revered Royal Air Force college in Cranwell. 

Returning to New Zealand to join the Vampire fighter squadron in Ohakea, Tom became a famed member of the RNZAF aerobatic team. Later he became a flying commander at Wigram air base, before captaining a Sunderland flying boat to isolated communities in the vast South Pacific, often to the upper limits of the plane's endurance. 

From the near-catastrophic opening of Wellington airport to flying Boeing 747s into the world's biggest airports, this is Tom Enright's story of the mishaps, misadventures and high-altitude drama of a 45-year flying career.

A taste of what’s to come:

     ? ?We have reason to believe that man first walked upright to free his hands for masturbation.”?Lily Tomlin

     ? A couple was lying in bed one evening, when the woman felt her husband begin to touch her in ways he hadn’t in quite some time. His fingers started at her neck, moved down her shoulders, past the side of her breast and so forth. Then he suddenly stopped, rolled over, and became silent. She said, ?Honey that was wonderful. Why did you stop?” ?I found the remote,” he mumbled.

With the same Snark Handbook style, this latest entry in the series will titillate, amuse, and entertain.

The City of Rockdale was a local government area in southern and St George regions of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The city centre was located 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) south of the Sydney central business district, on the western shores of Botany Bay. First proclaimed on 13 January 1871, Rockdale was formerly known as the Municipality of West Botany until 1887 and the Municipality of Rockdale before being proclaimed as a City in 1995. Rockdale was amalgamated with the neighbouring City of Botany Bay on 9 September 2016 to form the new municipality of Bayside Council.

The book includes the earliest accounts of the first Europeans to visit Milford Sound, the sealers, theAcheron surveyors and the geologists Sir James Hector and Robert Paulin.

New light is shed on the explorations of Donald Sutherland, the hermit of Milford Sound, and whether or not he climbed the Mackinnon Pass before Quintin Mackinnon. Here too, are the deeds of brave William Quill who climbed the Sutherland Falls three times; Jim Dennistoun who made the first ascent of Mitre Peak in a pair of gym shoes! And surveyor John Christie who descended the awful cliffs of the Homer Saddle on a wire rope.

The year is 2011, and what starts as a pervasive and inexplicable illness ends up as a zombie infestation that devastates the world's population. Taking the form of an illustrated journal found in the aftermath of the attack, this pulse-pounding, suspenseful tale of zombie apocalypse follows biologist Dr Robert Twombly as he flees from city to countryside and heads north to Canada, where -- he hopes -- the living dead will be slowed by the colder climate. Encountering scattered humans and scores of the infected along the way, he fills his notebook with graphic drawings of zombies and careful observations of their behavior, along with terrifying tales of survival. This frightening new contribution to the massively popular zombie resurgence will keep fans on the edge of their seats right up to the very end.

The result of five years of carefull research.

Joan Druett offers an informed and accessible account of little known stories of wives of whaling captains who accompanied their husbands on long and arduous journeys to bring whale oil and blubber to New England. Surprisingly, by 1850 roughly a sixth of all whaling vessels carried the captains' wives. Invariably the only woman aboard a very cramped ship, they endured harsh conditions to provide companionship for their husbands, and sometimes even exerted a strong unofficial moral influence on a rowdy crew. Joan Druett provides captivating portraits of many of these wives and the difficult circumstances they endured.

Petticoat Whalers, first published in New Zealand in 1991, has been out of print since 1995.

The Kendall Whaling Museum's L. Byrne Waterman Award citation states: ""It is not insignificant that Petticoat Whalers is already an indispensable classic""

Call it destiny. In 1984, while exploring the tropical island of Rarotonga, Joan Druett slipped into the hole left by the roots of a large uprooted tree, and at the bottom discovered the grave of a young American whaling wife, who had died at the age of 24 in January 1850. It was a life-changing experience for Joan. Her immediate interest in the subject of whaling captains’ wives at sea was encouraged by a Fulbright fellowship, which led to five months of research in New Bedford and Edgartown, Massachusetts; Mystic, Connecticut; and San Francisco, California. The result was her study of whaling captains’ wives under sail, Petticoat Whalers.

The most powerful of imperatives [is] the built-it animal desire to survive.

 The best and bravest of soldiers will eventually break down or runaway under stress, and he has no more choice in the matter than a starving man who steals a crust

This was not understood or anticipated when thousands of New Zealanders sailed off to the Great War -  Instead of adventure they found soldiering to be the tedium of the ship's voyage and the monotony of training. There was no glory in war, only the appalling conditions of trench warfare on the Western Front from which there was no escape. 

Many could not cope with these horrors and became disciplinary cases. 

There was little compassion for the misfit, the conscientious objector or those suffering from shell-shock and battle fatigue. There were court-martialled and received sentences ranging from the humiliation of field punishment to imprisonment or death by firing squad. 

The New Zealand Division became known as one of the finest serving in France, but part of the price paid for its high standard of discipline was the execution of its own men.

 In this book, acclaimed military historian Christopher Pugsley builds up a detailed picture of the circumstances that led to their deaths.

 ON THE FRINGE OF HELL will be an eyeopener to most New Zealanders, who until now were unaware of the sacrifices their forbears thought it necessary to make for the honour of their country.

Beginning with the historic meeting in 1904 of Henry Royce and the Honourable C.S. Rolls - and the birth in 1906 of the legendary Silver Ghost - Peter Pugh tells a story of genius - skill - hard work and dedication which gave the world cars and aero engines unrivalled in their excellence.

In 1915 - 100 years ago - the pair produced their first aero engine - the Eagle which along with the Hawk - Falcon and Condor proved themselves in battle in the First World War. 

In the Second the totemic Merlin was installed in the Spitfire and built in a race against time in 1940 to help win the Battle of Britain.With unrivalled access to the companys archives - Peter Pughs history is a unique portrait of both an iconic name and of British industry at its best....

It is the history of both the Martin family and the local Kupe district, and features stories of determination, financial hardships and pioneering feats faced by many families in the early days.  

Many of the stories are 'fiction based on fact' – some of Ron's imagination (and exaggeration) has gone into making these an easy read with a touch of humour and there is no intention to offend or discredit anyone in the telling of these stories.  

This is truly a wonderful collection of stories that will bring a smile to your face and in some cases a sense of familiarity of similar family tales told through the generations.

Gallipoli was researched and produced in seven different countries over a period of six years. Just like the film this book is based on this research and focuses on the human aspects of the campaign by portraying the experience of ordinary soldiers on both sides. But this book contains much of the material unearthed during the project's research that could not be included in the final film, because of the film's running time.

For nine months Turkish and allied soldiers battled not only with each other, but also with disease, the harsh climate, the terrain, and the horrific sights of modern warfare. Despite their hardships, they carried on with unprecedented dignity, courage and tenacity. They captured their experience in thousands of diaries, letters and photographs. This is their story told in their own word

NORSEWOOD. To many just a name on a signpost somewhere in Hawkes Bay on the main Napier Wellington highway pointing to the distant blue Ruahines. To others a town now off the main highway, ""Ghost Town;"" a town that was

But the ghosts of the past that haunt this small Scandinavian town were very real people as this book testifies, people who set out from Norway, Sweden and Denmark to brave unknown hardships and dangers, people who with fortitude, an unquenchable spirit and an unfailing sense of humour in the face of obstacles at last set up their homes in this little Town in the Southern Hemisphere.

Theirs is a fascinating story. Together they faced devastating bushfires which overnight almost completely wiped out their homes, churches and store. Faith was the very root of existence. Bound together by their dependence on each other for sheer survival. there emerged a hard-working, closely-knit community, ready to share their joys and sorrows alike, facing their difficulties with a wiry humour that rescued them from the most desperate situations. It is this Norsewood that Archie Andersen

reveals - a highly individual Scandinavian town. Himself of Danish pioneering stock - his father owned a sawmill in this heavily bushed area Archie Andersen was brought up to the stories of these early struggles and has always evinced a keen interest in them. Now, having spent most of his life in the area, he has gone to considerable research through early records, letters and newspapers to set down the centennial story of the town - the first 100 years of the town of Norsewood.

The United Steam Ship Company’s passenger service ran from 1875 to 1976, with thirty-six ships featuring in this book.

 Regarded as ‘queens of the seas’, they offered passengers excellent service in accommodation, entertainment and cuisine.

Drawing heavily on contemporary reports, the author has reconstructed the careers of these glamorous vessels which reigned supreme in coastal and ocean travel, through text and an extensive selection of black-and-white photographs.

An extensive selection of photographs attests to the remarkable standards of workmanship achieved in the fitting out and furnishing of cabins, dining saloons and places of relaxation. It seems no expense was spared in catering to passengers' comforts. 

Those who travelled on the Union Line during the heyday of ocean voyaging will find here a reservoir of pleasant memories. As well, this book must take its place as a valuable record of a bygone era. The delights of sailing aboard one of these notable ships are now things of the past, but A Century of Style offers the opportunity to reflect on their grandeur and the illustrious part they played in the history of transport.

Alexander's account of the 1972 World Championship Chess Match is unique in that he wrote the first half before it began. 

 He therefore captures the tension and excitement leading up to the match as someone who has yet to know its outcome, allowing the reader to get a more vivid taste of the suspense. It includes all 21 games with annotations. 

However, as the book was published only days after the match, the annotations are not as thorough as those of other books.

The Treaty of Waitangi is the most important document in New Zealand's history. 

Current Treaty issues and Maori/Pakeha relationships can only be understood within the wider story of New Zealand. 

As we understand and honour our history, we can acknowledge the need for restoration, healing and right relationships. The public response to previous editions of this bestselling book by Robert Consedine and his daughter Joanna Consedine has been strong and overwhelmingly positive. 

 This edition updates and expands on the critical issues: the foreshore and seabed debate, Maori access to political power, and the emergence of the Maori Party; the remarkable growth of the Maori economy, self-determination, Maori language and the developments in Maori education; constitutional issues, and the benefits of the Treaty settlement process. New Zealand and all New Zealanders have much to celebrate - and many challenges ahead.

 Drawing on Robert's unique experience as a leading Treaty educator, the powerful message of this book illustrates how each and every New Zealander across all cultures can discover a new sense of personal and national identity, grounded in an authentic Treaty relationship.

Laura Taylor was 10 years old when she arrived in Wanganui with her parents and brothers and sisters. The family had travelled in the Bay of Islands mission schooner, Columbine, and arrived to anchor in the river on the evening of 30 April 1843. On the following day they arrived at Putiki which was to be Laura’s home for the next sixteen years. Laura’s father, Reverend Richard Taylor MA, had been directed to assume duties at the Putiki Mission at Wanganui following the death of Reverend John Mason who had drowned at the mouth of the Turakina River in January 1843. In 1847 Laura commenced keeping a diary and it is this record that has been transcribed and edited to form this book. She tells of the daily life at Putiki where she lived until her marriage in 1859 to Thomas Henry Harper.

Laura’s story which was recorded at intervals up to 1857 is a very ordinary one, but one of the family’s dedication to the work of the mission in all its aspects. It is also a story of a very close family and of the life of Wanganui in those days. There was a steady stream of visitors to their house in the form of early settlers, military personnel and sometimes persons of national importance. Laura was bridesmaid to Kate Williams on the occasion of her marriage to Octavius Hadfield at Otaki and has left us a sketch of that event. In 1855 Laura accompanied her father and Hoani Wiremu Hipango to Australia and England where Richard Taylor published his first major work, Te Ika a Maui.

""Lachie Griffen is, in many ways, a symbol of Governors Bay. He has lived here for more than eighty years and is an entirely familiar figure, walking along the waterfront track, perhaps...or taking part in occasions at Cholmondeley Home. 

As Lachie, along with his head full of memories, strolls by, the history of Governors Bay strolls with him.""

(From the foreword by Margaret Mahy.)

At the age of 86, Lachie Griffen has taken on the formidable task of recording a lifetime of memories of his beloved Governors Bay. With exceptional recall and good humour, he recounts stories of his boyhood learning to farm alongside his father, training for war on horseback and fighting in tanks, winning his one true love, and making a success of his transport business. Interspersed are recollections of the 19 dogs that have kept him company over the years.

This book is best described as a compilation of historical articles written by Lynn. An extract from the introduction explains Lynn’s motivation for compiling this book when he notes its catalyst was an enquiry as to “whether I had any information on file about sambar deer in New Zealand.”

He goes on to say, “Not a lot has been written about the species for obvious reasons, but I remembered some serious historical research I had done early in my Government career into the animal’s introduction and liberation. I found the old Forest Service publication and was mightily surprised to note that it was published in 1966. Realising only too well that a whole new generation exists who have probably never had access to the old files, papers and magazines, and who had never heard of a certain old shooter and scribe, this book is the result.”

As alluded to, Lynn carried out a considerable amount of research, the result of which was a series of information booklets published on behalf of the New Zealand Forest Service (NZFS) and NZ Mountain Safely Council.

 Lynn also wrote A Hunting Guide: to Introduced Wild Animals of New Zealand (1973).

"PR1540","local history Early Pioneers Chinese",1.0000,FALSE,1817,,"History Of Chinese Fruitshops In New Zealand Hardback Vol 2 462 Pages",,"Long before supermarkets became a one-stop shop for fresh produce as they are today, local fruit and vegetable stores run by Chinese families were a pillar of our communities. This book chronicles the lives of these pioneering greengrocers and fruiterers as they carved their place into the countrys rich social and cultural tapestry. The personal anecdotes, historical documents and photos tell the stories of these families as they provided a vital service with a smile to their community and their journeys of growing up Kiwis. That includes the story of Colin Lowe of Norman Lowe Ltd in Whakatane: Being the son of a fruiterer meant you spent most of your spare time after school and in the weekends helping out. As a child I can still remember time spent unfolding unsold newspaper ready for wrapping veges in, unloading empty boxes and stacking them alongside the driveway ready for a carrier to collect them and take them to a market garden, sorting out the broken ones for repairing. These stories bring a unique perspective on New Zealands history as they trace the evolution of these shops from the general store-cum-greengrocery of the 1880s through to the fresh fruit and vegetable retailers we know today. It follows the fortunes and misfortunes of the Chinese in New Zealand through the hard times of the Depression and World War II, the growth and boom times of the 1950s and 60s and the challenge of supermarket giants eating up the competition.

Volume 2 (464 pages) presents stories from the Hawkes Bay region through to the Auckland region. The appendices include a list of all known Chinese fruit shops from the 1880s to the current day, and maps of the Guangdong counties the Chinese fruiterers originated from. Both volumes are fully-illustrated with photos, graphs and statistical tables.

The Fruits of Our Labours was written and researched by Ruth Lam, Beverly Lowe, Helen Wong, Michael Wong, and Carolyn King.

The volcanic origins of Banks Peninsula and the mountain-rimmed sweep of the Canterbury Plains make the region one of fascinating contrast.

Add to this the story of the people who settled and developed Canterbury and you have a rewarding study.

Peninsula and Plain is a compact, clearly written account of the place and the people; a story which began about 250 million years ago with the first stones of the Southern Alps.

Later twin volcanoes built Banks 'Island' and the craters became Lyttleton and Akaroa harbours.

Much later came the formation of the plains from the great shingle fans of the rivers.

The earliest men to set foot in Canterbury appear to have been the Moa-Hunters, about the ninth century.

Maori settlement followed and the appearance of Europeans culminated in the official founding of Canterbury in 1850, when the first four ships reached Lyttelton.

Today the progressive city of Christchurch and the prosperous settlements throughout Canterbury are the legacy of the pioneers.

Peninsula and Plain is attractively illustrated with historic and contemporary pictures, as well as maps and diagrams.

In lived a well referenced narrative, Matthew Wright traces 150 years of history, from the first European efforts to buy land in the Te Mata district through to the 1989 local body reforms.

Documents used here for the first time bring new insights into early land purchases, and through the letters, diaries, reminiscences and previously unpublished official correspondence of three generations Matthew Wright paints a tale of a community proud to call Havelock North their home.

A fearful sense of unnamed and unnamable disaster haunts the pages of the 11th novel by this acclaimed New Zealand writer ( Faces in the Water, Living in the Maniototo ), whose topsy-turvy vision of a world beyond bearing reminds us uneasily of our own. News of the Gravity Star, so-called because the nearer it hovers, the farther it recedes, and of the Memory Flower, Puamahara, which unleashes the land's memories and unites them with the future, so stirs rich New Yorker Mattina Brecon that she flies to New Zealand to visit the town of Puamahara, where the Memory Flower took palpable form. Driven to possess places that capture her fancy and the people therein, she rents a house on Kowhai Street, and sets out to know, possess, her neighbors. But they, like Mattina herself, are strangers, imposters, activated by the memory of another time and place. Increasingly, Puamahara resembles a graveyard, silent, unmoving, except for the great lolling exotic flower heads. As Mattina begins to discover the secrets of Kowhai Street, she senses in her bedroom a shape, quiescent but clearly there, akin to the formless pain inside her body.

Most New Zealand booklovers have heard of at least two of Lady Barker’s charming books on early colonial life — “Station Life in New Zealand” (first published in 1870) and “Station Amusements in New Zealand” (1873) — but how many have actually read them?
Rare today, they are not readily available outside libraries but, by the publication of the present facsimile editions, Wilson & Horton Ltd have brought them within reach of all who can appreciate New Zealand classics and wish to know more of this country’s beginnings.

In 1865, the author and her second husband, Frederick Broome, reached Christchurch on their way to take up a sheep run, 45 miles away in the foothills of the Southern Alps. The story of three happy years of life together there is told in a series of letters.
At Broomielaw, as they called their station, Lady Barker faced the unfamiliar round of domestic chores with the same cheerful acceptance as she crossed a mountain range in a heavy hailstorm, faced alone a charging (and very angry) boar, forced her horse to swim a flooded river or, as one of only five feminine partners available, danced until 4 a.m. at a country ball.
The author’s style has a charm and freshness vhich the passage of a century has dimmed not a whit. With an eye for essential detail and the sure instinct of an artist, she does not waste a single word.
Formerly Mary Anne Stewart, Lady Barker was born in Jamaica in 1831 and, in 1852, married Captain (later Sir) George Barker, who died in 1861. Four years afterwards she married Frederick Napier Broome, who, as Sir Frederick Broome, was Governor of Trinidad when he died in 1896. Previously he had been Lieutenant-Governor of Mauritius and Governor of Western Australia. Lady Broome (or Lady Barker, as she was known in New Zealand) died in 1911.

At the exact stroke of the hour, the great zinc-coated sphere will plummet with a whoosh from the top of the mast, a ritual that was enacted every day from 1876 to 1934 and more intermittently thereafter until the Canterbury earthquakes collapsed the tower and its three-storey station.

 Sadly, the station could not be saved, but the tower has been rebuilt and the timeball restored, with improved zinc cladding and an all-new automated mechanism.

 A pou created by mana whenua, Ngati Wheke, now stands alongside the reinstated Timeball tower, a visual symbol of the long history of maritime navigation in Aotearoa. 

As 1pm rolls around, spare a thought for the long maritime history at Whakaraupo/Lyttelton Harbour.

The definitive account of the New Zealand air crews' heroic and often deadly role in the dramatic and dangerous invasion of Europe in 1944 to the fall of Berlin the following year. 'Just another name, another place, another time for dying.'

 From hunting U-boats over the heaving waters of the cold Atlantic to dropping supplies for the Resistance and towing the gliders carrying paratroopers and weapons at Normandy, Arnhem and the Rhine crossing, the New Zealand airmen who fought with the RAF played an extraordinary role in the final chapters of World War II. 

In Victory, bestselling author Max Lambert shares the vivid, inspiring and previously unpublished stories of those young fliers - some still teenagers - who lived and died in the service of their country during the invasion of Normandy in 1944. Commemorating the 70th anniversary of D-Day and the beginning of the end of the war.

 Victory is both a thrilling account of courage and sacrifice, and a moving tribute to a passing generation of true heroes. PRAISE FOR MAX LAMBERT 'Night After Night is a classic'

In the mid 1920s, they emigrated to New Zealand. Elizabeth wrote that arriving gave her 'an indescribable glow of pleasure'; she felt that she was home. They settled at Raumati Beach, where they farmed and raised their only child. Although being a wife and mother was central to her notion of true womanhood, Elizabeth Kelso had a strong sense of public duty. She belonged to many civic bodies, wrote for several publications and was involved in adult education. But it was her work with the women's institutes of New Zealand that encapsulated her ideals.

In November 1929 Kelso became the inaugural president of the Paraparaumu Women's Institute. The monthly meetings and the library her branch built up were important to her, but it was at the national level that Kelso's real work with the institutes took place.

She was soon writing articles for the institutes' magazine, Home and Country, and after a period acting as sub-editor, took over the editorship from the October 1931 issue. The magazine took its title from the women's institutes' motto, 'For home and country'

Hints on the best way to catch trout in the waters Mr Cuthbertson has come to know so well are illustrated by accounts of amusing incidents encountered during a lifetime of fishing.

By John Thomson

The story of heroes - the soldiers, sailors and airmen who left New Zealand to do battle as front-line warriors. It is the story of New Zealand's rich record of loyalty, courage and sacrifice that built the confidence of a young nation. 

John Thomson's account covers a century of conflict, from the guerilla warfare in South Africa to the bloody disasters at Gallipoli, Passchendaele, Crete and Cassino, victories in the air over Europe and success in North Africa, Asia and the Pacific. 

In the first 50 years of the century, New Zealand servicemen fought three times in foreign lands in response to calls from Britain. The cost in human terms was staggering. In the second 50 years, young New Zealanders served as peacekeepers in trouble-spots around the world. 

Lest we forget, John Thomson has written this book so that every generation of New Zealanders will know the courage and character of those front-line warriors.

by Judith Bassett, Keith Sinclair, Marcia Stenson

The history of a country is the story of its people and the changes in their lives. 

This book tells the story of New Zealand in a new way, paying greater attention to the lives of the ordinary people and their families than other histories have done. It also includes the previously untold stories of many of the young people who came to New Zealand, and tells of their role in its development.

All the characters you would expect to find are here: Hone Heke, Governor Grey, Richard Seddon, Princess Te Puea, and Maui. In addition there are people who are less well known, such as Young Nick, who had his part to play in the discovery of New Zealand; the young Te Taniwha, who saw Captain Cook; and Christina Mcllvride, who delivered the mail. 

With its wealth of information, The Story of New Zealand is a valuable source of material on New Zealand's social history. Above all, it is entertaining and interesting, a book which will be read with enjoyment by people of all ages.

Based on the wartime diaries of Allied soldier and saboteur Tom Barnes, this account of thrilling WWII wartime deeds deep behind enemy lines in Greece is based on fact but reads like fiction. A thrilling read of wartime exploits, daring, intrigue and resourcefulness,

 The Sabotage Diaries is the astonishing true story of Allied engineer Tom Barnes, who was parachuted behind enemy lines in Greece in October 1942 with a small team of sappers and special operations officers. 

Their brief was to work with the Greek resistance in sabotage operations against the German and Italian occupation forces. Under-equipped and under-prepared but with courage to spare, their initial mission was to blow up a key railway bridge, cutting Rommel's supply lines to North Africa, where the battle of El Alamein was about to begin. 

But Operation Harling-as it was known-was only the start of a lengthy and perilous clandestine mission. Written by Tom Barnes' daughter-in-law, award-winning author Katherine Barnes, and drawn from Tom's wartime diaries, reports and letters, plus many other historical sources and first-hand accounts, this is a vivid and gripping tale of the often desperate and dangerous reality behind sabotage operations. 'A thrilling tale that could be straight out of the pages of an action adventure novel ... a remarkable and highly readable tale of a little known World War II operation.' Daily Telegraph 'Think the Guns of Navarone, but for real ... Explosions, mountains, dashing male partisans, dashing female partisans, big fat village weddings, treachery - it's all here in this thrilling and informative salute to an unsung hero of the Second World War.' Sunday Express UK 'Exciting and informative' Hobart Mercury 'The Sabotage Diaries has fantastically broad appeal ...

Cardcovered

In an age when young men took to the hills to protect New Zealand's bush from the ravages of deer and pigs (which the wisdom of the day had made responsible for all the ills that beset New Zealand), deer cullers were the nation's saviours. 

Men such as Barry Crump, Mike Bennett, Alan Farmer and all the others that have put pen to paper over the years to record the work carried out by these selfless heroes. Jonesy was there, starting in Ruatahuna in 1954, as a government shooter. Choppers had not been invented so it was tent camps, fixed wing airdrops four months apart, run out of anything and it was a long walk out for more supplies. Four bob a tail for deer, three shillings and sixpence for pigs, seven quid a week retainer. 

He was in the thick of it, trying hard to be good enough so he would not be shipped out, like so many were, that could not make the grade. Learning his bush craft and the ways of deer and pigs. Hunting from fly camps and department huts. Facing without flinching the privations and hardship that made up a deer culler's life. Spending his days in the bush hunting the elusive deer and pigs that he was paid to kill. 

In hindsight it was more like some giant ""boys own adventure."" Compulsory Military Training interrupted things for a brief while, but doing your CMT with the likes of Colin Meads and other mates from Te Kuiti was really no hardship. 

Then the triumphant return to the outdoor life and Lake Christobel in the South Island. So sit back, relax and relive the years and yarns with Colin Jones. Return to an age when men were men, women were nowhere in sight and the deer were supposed to be everywhere.

By Grosz, Chris 

Chris Grosz captures in words and pictures the adventuring life of sailor, soldier, deserter, outlaw and Hau Hau slave, Kimball Bent. After signing up for the Queen's shilling, Bent was sent to New Zealand in the 1860s, on the eve of the tumultuous Taranaki land wars. An act of defiance saw Bent deserting the army, and his eventual adoption by Maori tribes. Kimball Bent: Malcontent illustrates Bent's life as a Pakeha Maori, his assimilation into tribal life, his observation of secret war rites, including cannibalism, and being on the side of the Hau Hau at the famous battle at Te Ngutu o Manu where Gustav von Tempsky was killed. One of New Zealand's folk heroes, Bent's story encompasses romance, bloodshed and mayhem. 

His story has been recorded by James Cowan and fictionalised by Maurice Shadbolt. Rendered in scraperboard style, this graphic novel will have crossover appeal for teenagers and adults alike, bringing Bent's story to a new generation of New Zealanders.

John Robert Godley (1814-61) founder of Canterbury, has received surprisingly little historical attention for the past 50 years. 

With the recent celebration of the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the province's settlers, this book reconsiders this major figure in history. 

Rather than being a conventional biography, ""Remembering Godley"" represents several disciplines - family history, political history, art history and heritage studies - with individual essays provided by writers with specific and relevant knowledge, providing an overdue study of an eminent personality in New Zealand's history. 

The book draws extensively on primary and unpublished material (for example, the courtship letters from John Robert to his wife, Charlotte) and its contributors are all prominent in their respective areas. A genuine attempt has been made by the editor and contributors to balance scholarly insight with a readable, jargon-free text which is accessible to specialists and non-specialists alike.

The war in the South Pacific saw some of the most gruelling fighting of World War Two. Conditions were unpleasant - fetid heat, torrential downpours and hostile flora and fauna - while the Japanese enemy were ruthless and would often fight to the last man. Amphibious warfare, jungle warfare and the need to co-operate with our American ally all meant that new demands were made on New Zealand soldiers. 

Yet the war in the South Pacific came to be seen as an easy war, generally overlooked (with the exception of Guadalcanal) by historians. From ignorance of what the soldiers were called upon to endure, the notion arose that service in the South Pacific was somehow less worthy than the 'real war' in Europe against the Nazis. 

This attitude continued in the post-war world and today the soldiers of 3NZ Division are all but forgotten. Pacific Star sets the record straight, shedding new light on the sacrifices and tribulations which the soldiers of 3NZ Division had to endure in the service of the Allied cause. 

The book covers their initial deployment in Fiji and New Caledonia, and describes the major battles the division fought in the Solomons: Vella Lavella, the Treasury Islands and the Green Islands, as well as their sometimes strained relationship with the US military. Reg Newell has interviewed veterans for this book, which includes new maps and previously unpublished photographs.

By Gordon McLauchlan

Gordon McLauchlan presents a biography of Auckland city that reflects his passion for the place. 

This is a colourful history, filled with anecdotes and asides. Gordon traces the history of settlement in the Auckland region, and illustrates the huge differences in the way the town began and the way it has continued to exist as spontaneous, commercial city from diverse cultural sources. Gordon argues that Auckland is, and always has been, different to the rest of the country: 'more cosmopolitan, more mercantile, more susceptible to change and modernity'. 

In this book he explores why. His willingness to express his opinion about other New Zealand towns and cities is likely to raise provincial passions, but his fascination for the development of New Zealand's largest city, and his advocacy for the city's future, will draw in readers from around the country.

Paul Tritenbach traces the development of New Zealand's best known parks from their establishment, through to the present day. 

It is divided into 19 chapters, each giving an historical chronology of a particular park, using photographs, maps and text. 

The historic photographs and maps are superb, and tell much about the development of these parks and the early plantings of exotics. 

They show what a tremendous resource is stored in our museums and libraries, and how valuable photographic material can be as an historic record.

The author has been selective in the parks chosen, and tried to include those that are largest and oldest as well as those that show historical differences.

This monograph on Don Driver's work highlights the diversity of his practice and includes sculpture, painting, assemblage works, collage and installation. The book aims to amplify and compliment the Govett-Brewster exhibition.


Driver is a colourist and uses found objects and materials as pure colour elements in his works, in much the same way Matisse used cut paper.

 Easily classified as a sculptor, working as he does for the most part in three dimensions, Driver's passion for colour is as up front in his three-dimensional works as it is in paintings like Relief No.10 (1972).

 He has often blurred the boundaries between sculpture and painting. His works are visual feasts and yet challenging at the same time.

On 6 April 1945, a Japanese kamikaze pilot breaks cloud at 3,000 feet, near the island of Ishigaki. He plunges his Suisei divebomber into a fatal dive at the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. On the signals deck, Chief Petty Officer W. T. Holman sees him coming - he has just seconds to react. Intense and accurate fire from the ship blows the plane off course; it crashes into the sea. Its 1,000-pound bomb explodes beside the great ship in the nearest of near-misses. Later in life, Jeffrey Paparoa Holman begins to ask questions:

 Why did his father live and that pilot die? Who was the pilot and did he have any family who survived him? What was the meaning of such an odds-against moment of war? 

The answers lead Jeffrey into the heart of a troubled relationship with his father, combat veteran, alcoholic and problem gambler; into his past and his wartime marriage; to the names and faces of the six kamikaze who died that day in 1945; and, in 2011, to miraculous and deeply moving meetings with Japanese brothers of those aircrew, old men who welcome him into their homes like a long-lost family member.

Major Robert Adams Wilson DSO, the second son of a Rangitikei sheep farmer, was brought up in a privileged and cultured household.

 Inspired by his Scottish father, a Member of Parliament, and his Australian mother who was a noted writer, Bob had an enquiring and innovative mind, a firm belief in science and a love for literature and the arts. 

He was a keen polo player and a forward-thinking businessman whose interests in sawmilling culminated in the chairmanship of two of the North Island's most important timber companies. 

He successfully planted and farmed a large area of Himitangi coastal sand country, and he established the highly successful Mahoe Friesian Stud, but his greatest love was for the rugged and isolated places of New Zealand. 

For nearly four decades he went deerstalking in South Westland and Otago, and after serving in the British Army in World War One he encouraged English sportsmen to do the same.

 He was an authority on native birds, joining ornithologists Edgar Stead and Geoffrey Buddle on numerous research expeditions to New Zealand's most inhospitable offshore islands. 

He wrote for a variety of newspapers and journals, and he bred lilies and rhododendrons. A high mountain pass, an island bay, several native plants and a rare southern fernbird were named after him, yet he had no public profile and was little known outside his own circles. 

This book tells the story of a twentieth-century gentleman who lived on his own terms in the Rangitikei.

New Zealanders were among the world's first aviators, with our geography and location making the prospect of flight an attractive one for our people and our nation. It comes as no surprise then that tens of thousands have served in not only the Royal New Zealand Air Force but in numerous air forces in peace, and in war around the world.

 Those New Zealanders were among the first to take to the air like a swift to the sky. This brief account cannot do justice to them all but it serves to convey something of the nature of the challenges they have met and overcome, and of the sacrifices they have made, during the astonishingly rapid progress of aviation from its earliest beginnings, when every flight was an event if not a minor miracle, to the present, when aircraft have become so reliable that aircrew are almost in danger of becoming redundant. 

Told through the collections of the Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum, this book is highly illustrated with ephemera, personal accounts, aircraft and previously unpublished photographs, together with a text following the development of our air forces, from its birth over the muddy trenches of WW1, to today's mobile defence force support backbone.

Readers with a collector's interest in early New Zealand ceramics - and there is a growing collectors' market for early New Zealand wares - will find this an invaluable resource for identifying their finds, be they pickle jars, teapots, or ducks flying up a wall. 

There are few households in New Zealand today which do not boast in the kitchen or living room some small example of the wares of an earlier era in the history of ceramics in this country.

 Yet how many know of the hundred years or more of endeavor by which pioneer craftsmen, isolated from the familiar materials and markets of their homeland, struggled to establish what is today a major manufacturing industry. 

Drawing largely on oral accounts of this time of determination, initiative and drive, the author has rescued from oblivion not only examples of most of these early wares, but also the stories of the men who shaped them.

A personal commentary on the war years from one of our most distinguished soldiers – Lt General Sir Leonard Thornton 

How does a soldier cope with years of enforced separation from the family he loves? What does he really think about the war he is fighting? Bill Gentry (later to become Major General Sir William Gentry) answers these and other questions in the very frank letters he wrote home to his wife, Lalla, while overseas as an officer with 2nd New Zealand Division during World War II. 

In these absorbing letters Bill brings to us the experience of life in the turbulent days of war. We share the uncertain …..

In its 125 very eventful years the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand sent its ships to just about every port in the country and to many overseas. Until the 1960s, you might have seen up to half a dozen colliers at a time lining the quays at Greymouth and Westport, their no-nonsense funnels and derricks throwing up a great red and buff-coloured forest of steel. 

On the other side of the island you would have wandered along the wharf at Oamaru to see the Waipiata, the Kanna or the Katui discharging factory goods from Auckland and Wellington and loading flour and lime for the return trip. Until the 'fifties' Aucklanders or Wellingtonians would have been on the look out for the trans-Tasman stalwarts Maunganui or Monowai, bringing mail, foreign papers, passengers and gossip. In earlier decades their Bluff and Dunedin counterparts would have followed the movements of the Union liners on the old 19th century 'horseshoe run'. 

They said that the capital's residents set their watches by the ferries that ran like clockwork between Wellington and Lyttelton. At Auckland, the company's Pacific Island freighters brought a touch of the exotic with their cargoes of tropical fruit and sugar. In 1999, however, that all came to an end. Union sold its last large ships, leaving just a seagoing tug and barge to briefly carry its flag across the threshold of the millennium.",FALSE,,TRUE,2.00,2.00,15.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;13.0=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;0.0=Pick up No Cost;2.0=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2022-07-31 09.53.14.jpg;img20210104085702.jpg;2022-07-31 09.53.25.jpg;2022-07-31 09.53.38.jpg;2022-07-31 09.53.42.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"BOX 1",TRUE,FALSE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

There was a romance about railways in the days of steam that made legends of the trains and the men who ran them.

 Little of Australia's workaday or social life was not affected by the lonesome whistle that winkled its way into every corner of the land. 
A train whistle; the sound that probably more than any other sound on earth has caused boys to run away from home, to become footloose and long for faraway places.

Patsy Adam-Smith rode the rails to Marble Bar in Western Australia on the 'Spinifex Flyer'; the line from Normanton to Croyden, isolated in Queensland's Gulf country, the tiny mountain lines in Tasmania's southwest, past the Montezuma Falls where water sprayed over the tracks; and the long, straight line across the Nullarbor's semi-desert. 

She brings alive the railway folk who were proud to belong to the great family of railway workers the drivers who only took leave when their engines were due for overhaul, the station masters and mistresses isolated on lonely lines, and the fettlers who took pride in being able to swing a 28-pound hammer when the temperature was 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade. 

This book captures the magic of days when life had more meaning, fellowship and certainty...

Clasic edition GOLDEN PRESS


Most New Zealand booklovers have heard of at least two of Lady Barker’s charming books on early colonial life — “Station Life in New Zealand” (first published in 1870) and “Station Amusements in New Zealand” (1873) — but how many have actually read them?

In 1865, the author and her second husband, Frederick Broome, reached Christchurch on their way to take up a sheep run, 45 miles away in the foothills of the Southern Alps. The story of three happy years of life together there is told in a series of letters.

At Broomielaw, as they called their station, Lady Barker faced the unfamiliar round of domestic chores with the same cheerful acceptance as she crossed a mountain range in a heavy hailstorm, faced alone a charging (and very angry) boar, forced her horse to swim a flooded river or, as one of only five feminine partners available, danced until 4 a.m. at a country ball.

The author’s style has a charm and freshness which the passage of a century has dimmed not a whit. With an eye for essential detail and the sure instinct of an artist, she does not waste a single word.

Formerly Mary Anne Stewart, Lady Barker was born in Jamaica in 1831 and, in 1852, married Captain (later Sir) George Barker, who died in 1861. Four years afterwards she married Frederick Napier Broome, who, as Sir Frederick Broome, was Governor of Trinidad when he died in 1896. 
Previously he had been Lieutenant-Governor of Mauritius and Governor of Western Australia. Lady Broome (or Lady Barker, as she was known in New Zealand) died in 1911.

His first book Something to Roar About was a complete sellout success, now he once again takes the reader along on some of his more memorable trips.

Success is not always measured by meat or fish on the table. Friendships made, the camaraderie of the hunt and the joy of being out in the back blocks of New Zealand and Australia, just having fun, is what it is all about.

Although retired and confessing to slowing down a little, Graham manages more hunting than many a fraction of his age. 

With the ability of a natural storyteller and a bush poet this latest collection of yarns is sure to win even more fans than his first book.

Written in 1922, this touching tale of a cloth rabbit’s quest to become ‘Real’ is a masterpiece among children’s illustrated books. With its nostalgic nod to the fairy-tale tradition, it has inspired many fantastical tales about talking toys and remains a bedtime favourite almost 100 years later.

Bryan B Sterling interviewed Will Rogers' co-workers and others who knew him best for a unique book of personal insights into the man behind the jokes. A must read for Will Roger's buffs.

Will Rogers (1879-1935), starting life as a cowhand, and went on to become a stage and motion picture star and a noted homespun philosopher. He is still regarded as one of the greatest ropers of all time. But it was his shrewd witticism he made while performing his tricks, that won him fame and fortune. A talented writer, Rogers’s short comments on the news appeared in about 350 daily newspapers. In 1926, he toured Europe as President Calvin Coolidge’s “ambassador of good will.” The following year, his admirers chuckled over his Letters of a Self-Made Diplomat to His President  (1927).  But Roger’s was at his best giving a performance. His usual opening, “All I know is what I read in the papers,” became a byword during the 1920’s.

They were the best of enemies - dedicated, skilled and deadly. In the night skies above wartime Germany, a RAF navigator-bomber from New Zealand and a Luftwaffe pilot seek out their targets, testing the gap between success and their own destruction as they cross each other's paths,

The odds are heavily against either of them making it through the war, but as this sobering realization displaces their initial exuberant adventurism, both come to see in their youthful sacrifice the survival of all they hold dear. Under a Bomber's Moon reaches across the divide of years of geography and nationality to tell their story largely in their own words - describing both the breathtaking clashes in the air and the camaraderie, humour, patriotism and personal tragedies that became their war. 

Stephen Harris began his journey of discovery because he wanted to know the truth of his great-uncle Colwyn Jones' fate. With Col's vividly written letters and diaries as a starting-point, he set out to discover what really happened.

200 pages, hundreds of b/w and some colour illustrations

Although born only in 1937, the Royal New Zealand Air Force has built traditions and created standards that now stamp it as second to none anywhere in the world. To honour the RNZAF's first half-century, author Geoffrey Bentley and artist Maurice Conly have collaborated on a handsome and informative account of the Service's history, and of the people and aircraft who have made it what it is today. The RNZAF story begins with the pioneering efforts of a handful of post-World War One flying enthusiasts, with the formation of the Kohimarama and Sockburn flying schools and with the years of indifference when lack of government interest hampered the growth of military aviation

Portrait of An Air Force goes on to tell of the modest expansion programme launched in 1937 by Ralph Cochrane, the first RNZAF Chief of Air Staff, and the rapid development forced by the advent of the Second World War in which New Zealanders served with conspicuous gallantry in every theatre. Geoffrey Bentley describes the achievements of No. 75 (New Zealand) Bomber Squadron, the New Zealand Spitfire Squadron and the other RNZAFdominated RAF units. He also traces the RNZAF involvement in the South-West Pacific campaign and relates the heroic last stand of a New Zealand squadron of the RAF at the fall of Singapore

The postwar period is dealt with in equal detail , the part played by No. 14 Squadron in Japan and later in Cyprus, the Berlin Airlift, the RNZAF contribution in Antarctica, relief missions and mercy flights in Bangladesh and the South......

Make a magical gesture, and the die slowly and visibly sinks through the first blade and rests on top of the second. Again, a magical gesture, and it slowly penetrates the second blade, sliding down to the base!

This book is unashamedly, a pot pourri of nostalgia for those who love motoring. It covers from the first acceptance of the motor car by societies devoted to the horse through the beginnings of international racing in France in 1902. It continues to the revolutionary Volkswagen People's Car of the 30's which brought the delights of the open road to millions, and the eight years before World War 11, when motor racing was alive with excitement.

Kurt Gerhardt Johannsen, born and bred in ‘The Red Centre’, is a quiet, modest man with a knack for improvising, fixing things and inventing solutions to the many problems he has encountered in his working life during the infancy of road transport, as well as in his mining and other adventures.

In the late 1800’s and early 1900’s quite ‘ordinary’, humble, hard-working men and women set off into the unknown in the Northern Territory and lived remarkable, extraordinary, courageous lives. We are often astounded at what they endured and did when we look back over the past few decades of their achievements and heartbreaks in that beautiful, wild and often harsh and uncompromising land.

These memoirs, first recounted onto audio tapes by Kurt in 1987, following heart surgery in December, 1986, tell many of his adventures, mishaps and achievements and reveal some of his fortitude, integrity, humour and intelligence. He is a visionary with ideas that were often ahead of his time.

Based on extensive research, it brings to life a mixed crew of ship-owners, politicians, mariners, doctors, nurses and patients as they battle sea-sickness, explore foreign lands, pull rank, mutiny, squabble over privileges and bitch about food while still managing to care for patients under difficult and often dangerous circumstances.

 Life on a hospital ship was no pleasure cruise. Much more than a book directed at maritime or medical history buffs, The White Ships illustrates many of the war's big issues. It explores the role of government, from the relationship between the governor and his ministers to New Zealand's relationship with British officials, especially over transport allocation. On the home front, it examines community fundraising and soldier support, attitudes to alcohol, labour relations and - using private business records - the vexed question of war profits and profiteering.

 Here they trace the development of the electric guitar, from early experiments and patent applications to the latest designs of the 1990s and beyond. But the authors are concerned with more than just the historical development of one instrument; they tell the entire story of popular music in the second half of the 20th century. 

In less than 50 years, the electric guitar has become one of the key instruments of the genre. (By 1998, they note, well over one million new guitars were sold each year in the United States alone.) In telling this tale, the book traces the work of pioneers Leo Fender, Lloyd Loar, Les Paul, and Ted McCarty as well as the evolution of the guitar's design, from early, rudimentary prototypes to modern composite guitars. 

Well organized and illustrated with more than 200 full-color photographs (including fine vintage electrics as well as futuristic models for the 21st century), this book would complement any music collection.

Within a few years of the first settlement of Sydney, pioneer families were establishing themselves along the Hawkesbury River and in the Macdonald and Mangrove Creek valleys. This book tells the story of their hardships and achievements in an area then wild and remote.

Read about the busy river traffic, convict road builders, early mail services, law and order and the long-vanished inns, churches and schools. Many colourful characters, amusing incidents and dramatic events bring the past to life.

Written by local historians and illustrated with many unusual photographs. It is a guide to a rich but little-known past that will interest residents and the many tourists who visit the area.

"PR1726",,1.0000,FALSE,1952,,"New Zealanders In Bomber Command Night After Night 528 pages 2005",,"1,850 young Kiwi pilots died flying for the RAF/RNZAF during the Second World War, taking the fight directly to the war machine of Nazi Germany. This the story of these men, all too often overlooked in the annals of NZ military history.

For anyone who doubts that war is anything other than brutally personal, read this book. Read of the young Kiwi men who flew flaming bombers knowingly to their deaths, providing just enough time for their crews to bail out. Read of the airmen thrown in the Buchenwald concentration camp, made POWs or executed by the Gestapo. Read of men barely out of school -or with young families at home - who volunteered to brave the firestorm of flak, the night-fighters of the Luftwaffe, and the often extreme conditions - knowing that the chance of long-term survival was slim.

As harrowing as many of these personal stories are, what is truly humbling is the deep veneration that these airmen are still held in communities around Europe. There are graveyards and memorials in France, Norway, Denmark, England, Belgium - and even Germany - where local communities tend the graves, hold services and continue to honour the sacrifices made by these young men from so far away. For us living in peaceful times, not knowing of the horrors of living under a Nazi occupation - this may seem odd after nearly 70 years. That it is true I have witnessed personally on my travels, and is attested by many moving examples in Max Lambert's lovingly researched homage.


Few New Zealanders know that Bomber Command had the longest tour of duty of all services, with the most shocking casualty rates. Lambert's book rights this wrong, but is at is most unforgettable when it shares the personal, tragic stories of the fight for the airspace above occupied Europe

A personal account by a fourth-generation New Zealander whose forebears arrived with the first colonists in 1840. The author, Thora Melita Perkins (nee Jenkins), helped by family diaries and memoirs, takes the family story to 1940. Gathering the material meant travelling from Spirits Bay in the north to Milford Sound in the south.

 She combines a penetrating, inquiring research with a fine sense of the romantic in the portrayal of general pioneering in New Zealand. History comes alive in the stories of land development; the Tarawera eruption in which a relative was killed; and shipwreck. the intriguing enterprise of the Maori's trip to England with her great-grandfather, William Jenkins and fellow colonists in 1863, is here told from the family's point of view for the first time, with glimpses of Victorian England, and the trip's ultimate effect of Maoridom.

 Harry, William's grandson, took a prominent part in the pioneering of the milking machine in dairy farming in New Zealand and overseas. A touch of romance is intrioduced in the relating of 30 years of adventurous boating in Auckland, the Bay of islands, and cruising in the Pacific in well-known boats. An unusual finale in the Solomon Islands gives evidence of the missionary zeal William Jenkins inspired in succeeding generations of the family

An Encyclopedia of New Zealand Railways

Paperback: 158 pages  

Publisher: Grantham House Publishing October 2003

Robin Bromby captures the nostalgia of the branch line trains that once meandered into quiet country settlements with their mixed bag of fertiliser, beer, sheep and timber consignments, the sleek main line expresses, the scrums that formed at refreshment counters for tea and pies, and the feats of engineering that allowed the steel road to cross mountain ranges and deep gorges.

Rails that Built a Nation is an indispensable reference work for all those interested in New Zealand Rail History.

This is not only an indispensable reference work, it is also a delightfully evocative account of how our railways grew and dominated the nation's transport industry.

The ""Lines"" section describes each in detail, with easy-to-read dates of opening and closing, length, history and passenger services.

""Along the Track"" remembers the many trains that ran along these lines - from boat trains through to coal trains, mixed trains, railcars and suburban services.

""Railways at Work"" takes the reader inside the system - the duties required of guards, the joys of the railway refreshment rooms, station names, the growth and variety of railway workshops, the tunnels and viaducts

An entirely new look at the shocking impact of the First World War on New Zealand.

For New Zealand, World War One was wholly avoidable, wholly unnecessary — and almost wholly disastrous. 

Stevan Eldred-Grigg believes that the enormous cost of the war to our people was way too high — and that we still feel its effects, both socially and culturally, today. 

This is excellent narrative non-fiction, analysing our history in a novel way. It's very accessible but is backed up by meticulous research.

 Stevan goes against the accepted line and gives us a fascinating look at our social history before, during and just after WW1. 

Why did we go to the war in Europe? Was the country united in its desire for war? What were the economic and social consequences? What has been the impact on the psyches of New Zaeland men? 

These and many other questions are answered

Joan Bullock Morrell: Sculptor, written by Wanganui-based author Valerie Cowan, is a lavishly-illustrated book which examines Joan's inspiration for each of her sculptures and takes the reader through the creative process of sculpting. Joan is recognised as being at the forefront of sculpting in New Zealand – a medium she has pursued since the 1960s.

Born in Wanganui in 1928, Joan received the New Zealand Commemoration Medal in 1990 in recognition of services to the country. In 1995 she was awarded the Queen’s Service Medal. She has been commissioned by Wanganui to produce sculptures for the community and currently she is working on a commissioned James K Baxter sculpture for Wanganui’s Guyton Street. Joan has a private gallery on a Wanganui property which is open to the public when requested. The gallery showcases approximately 60 sculptures. 

‘I don’t ever draw what I am going to make. If I did then it would be done and I wouldn’t need to make a sculpture. I just have it in my head and I do it. I can see it in my mind better than I can draw.’

Valerie Cowan is no stranger to telling the stories of extraordinary New Zealanders. Her previous books include Pigs and Me: Tales of the Bygone Bush, Goodness Gracious Me: Pioneering Stories from Five Nzers and Bridging the Centuries. To write Joan Bullock Morrell: Sculptor, Valerie spent countless hours listening to and interviewing Joan. The result is the impressive story of an artist who in her eighties continues to work and has her work in private collections in Europe, Asia and North America. Her sculptures have also enchanted visitors to Wanganui’s public spaces including Kowhai Park and Virginia Lake.

How could a celebration of peace, love and music spiral downwards into depths of violence, blackmail and fear? Sweetwaters, the iconic festival that brought so many people together during the heyday of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, took a very public and controversial turn for the worse in 1999. Sweetwaters the book, as told by festival organiser Daniel Keighley, sets the record straight. This is a riveting look at an exhilarating period of music and creativity - the musicians Elvis Costello, Talking Heads, Eurythmics, The Psychedelic Furs, UB40, The Pretenders and Simple Minds, as well the cream of the Kiwi crop, the people and personalities of the time. This fascinating autobiography details Keighley?s involvement in and passion for connecting music and people, and is a blow-by-blow, 'behind the scenes' account of the now notorious 1999 festival. Keighley has a story to tell. His side of the story. Having recounted the heady highs of previous Sweetwaters events, he then leads you through the extreme lows that followed the demise of the 1999 event: gang violence, public slander, bankruptcy and imprisonment.
He writes of such deeply personal trials with blunt honesty, unflinching detail and great humility. Sweetwaters is, as the saying goes, the next best thing to being there - or perhaps better. The untold story is no longer secret. It is the concluding chapter in the incomplete saga.

It shows the growth of North Queensland in terms of the unfold- ing of its main industries: mining, sugar, squatting. It is a story of development and of struggle.

Here are to be found briefly the colourful facts of the origins of many North Queensland towns and movements. The book reveals the difficulties, trials and tasks of the early settlers and it gives us a few points on the life of buccaneering types like Robert Towns.

From this history can be gleaned how, steadily, in dribs and drabs, finance capital moved into the North into industry after industry. This provides us with a key to an understanding of what has taken place.

Many of the hardships of the early settlers and particularly of their women folk are made plain: 'Infant in arms and with small tired children, mother faced the roughest conditions. The lean-to kitchen had two iron bars over an open fire for cooking, a gypsy cauldron swung on a hook for heating water, and bread was baked in a camp oven, and water was short.

You can almost see the scene; you can almost also see the picture of the Charters Towers Beef riots of November 1872 when a crowd took ropes and pulled down the shop of a butcher who had refused to lower his prices

Barrett was born and raised in the slums of either Durham or Bermondsey, England He spent six years as a sailor and arrived in Taranaki from Sydney as a mate on the trading vessel Adventure in March 1828.

 He and captain John Agar ""Jacky"" Love established a trading post at Ngamotu (site of modern-day New Plymouth), trading muskets and trinkets for flax, maize, wheat and vegetables grown by local Te Atiawa Maori. The trading post attracted increasing numbers of passing ships.

Barrett picked up a rudimentary understanding of the Maori language, was given the name of Tiki Parete and married Rawinia, the daughter of a local chief.

In 1832 Barrett and his former crewmates (recalled as Akerau, probably Akers, Tamiriri, probably Wright, Kopiri probably Phillips, and Oliver in 1873) joined local Maori in the Otaka pa at Ngamotu (Moturoa) to aid their defence in the face of an attack by heavily armed Waikato Māori, firing on the invaders with three cannon, using nails, iron scraps and stones for ammunition. The siege lasted more than three weeks before the Waikato withdrew, leaving a battle scene strewn with bodies, many of which had been cannibalised. In June Barrett and Love migrated south with as many as 3000 Atiawa Māori.

In late 1833 or early 1834, Barrett and Love established a whaling station at Queen Charlotte Sound.

This book is both beautiful to look at and a delight to read.

Social historian Bee Dawson traces the development of gardening in New Zealand, from the Maori gardens of pre- and early- contact times to the optimistic efforts of missionaries and other early settlers.

 It showcases the magnificence and productivity of the Victorians and Edwardians, the ascendancy of the Kiwi quarter acre, the Dig for Victory campaigns of the 1940s and gardening into the new millennium.

Illustrated throughout with historic photographs, paintings and ephemera, Dawson's lively writing style brings to life the successes and failures and the sense of achievement felt by New Zealand gardeners through the years, as they coaxed plenty and beauty from a new earth.

Tom Heeney - a kiwi who made ripples in international boxing circles during the 1920s. The hardworking and physically powerful Heeney was a sensation at home and abroad, making it as far as the fight for the 1928 World Heavyweight title in New York. 

“Boxer Tom Heeney was New Zealand’s first international sporting hero, a contender in New York for the World Heavyweight title in 1928. Though he lost the fight (after 11 brutal rounds) New Zealanders exulted then, as now, in the ‘world class’ status of one of our own. With a reputation for doggedness and straight dealing in a notoriously corrupt game, ‘Honest Tom’ became a rich man and footed it with the smart set in Jazz Age Manhattan and eventually parlayed his good name into a long and successful second career running a celebrity bar in Miami. In the process of writing Heeney’s biography, Dublin-based New Zealander Lydia Monin unearthed a wealth of information and met many colourful commentators.

Napoleon Bonaparte is often credited with saying that 'an army marches on its stomach'. A hundred years after his time, the soldiers of the Great War would do little marching. Instead, they would fight their battles from cold, muddy trenches, looking out across No Man's Land towards another set of trenches that housed the enemy. It is one of the remarkable successes of the war that they rarely went hungry.

During the war, the army grew from its peace-time numbers of 250,000 to well over 3 million. They needed three meals a day and, using the men's own letters and diaries, John Hartley tells the story of the food they ate, how it got to them in those trenches and what they thought of it. It's the story of eating bully beef and army 'dog biscuits' under fire and it's the story of the enjoyment of food parcels from home or eating egg and chips in a café on a rare off-duty evening. It's also the story of the lives of loved ones at home – how they coped with rationing and how women changed their place in society, taking on jobs previously held by men, many working as farm labourers in the Women's Land Army.

Paperback - 164 pages  with illustrations, some colour photographs published  2010

Excellent condition

After being introduced to the Hokianga, its mysteries, mystique and Kupe's relationship to the harbour, readers are transported back in time, to the bushmen's camp, just before dawn on a February morning in 1938.

 Gordon then guides his readers throughout the day as it unfolds, retracing the bush tracks that he trod so many times during his youth, and following a typical working day with the bushmen and their team of 20 bullocks. 

Gordon tells his story to great effect, using his own manner of speaking. This must surely be a rare achievement indeed as the men who had such experiences are today certainly very few. Gordon surrounds his readers with the sights, sounds and aromas of the New Zealand bush and throughout the course of the day readers experience many awesome moments: some hair raising as readers encounter Taipo: some quite ordinary as they happen on this day in 1938. 

Gordon explains many matters of general interest such as aspects of the Maori language and culture; trees and birds that have lived in the bush since almost the beginning of time; and above all the bushmen and of course the actions of the mighty cattle beasts and their driver. These are experiences few, if any readers will have ever had and certainly will never ever have again.

In his first book, Chris Fraser described the symptoms of Pig Huntingitis, as owning a 4WD truck with a dog box on the back, along pointed knife, a collection of motley looking dogs and when you are talking with your mates every second sentence has the word pig in it at least once. Fortunately not a life-threatening problem, except possibly for the pigs. 

The progress from just infected to chronic is described in the stories in this book Chronic Pig Huntingitis. As it progresses it involves wives, children, friends even casual acquaintances. Rather than alarming it becomes life affirming as lots of fresh air and exercise in the pursuit of pigs improves overall health and the pigs provide nutritional food that is totally organic and as free range as it is possible to be. It provides for family oriented activity as wives, girlfriends, sons and daughters, friends and other sufferers can join in. It provides healthy exercise and vocations for dogs that might otherwise have been put down at the pound. In all, it's about as good as life can get!

We  know him as the guy with guns, tusks, furs and other weird stuff who pops up on Border Patrol from time to time. He's Davey Hughes, the founder of Swazi Outdoor Clothing, and this is his story. As a kid in Wainuiomata he spent the weekends in the hills going after pigs and possums. Now he's hunted caribou in the Arctic circle, grizzlies in Alaska and buffalo in Tanzania. But there's more to Davey Hughes (aka Swazi Man) than a remarkable hunting life and a taste for adventure.

He and his wife Maggie have built a outdoor clothing empire on their proudly made-in-New Zealand Swazi brand, he funds a Siberian tiger conservation campaign and he's a passionate advocate for kids getting into our back country and having the roughing-it adventures that kick-started his remarkable life.

In this rollicking book, Davey shares his hunting tips, his scariest adventures, his favourite camp-cooking recipes and his poems. He even tells you how to skin a mountain lion – handy, should you ever meet one.

Davey Hughes is the founder owner of Swazi Outdoor Apparel, one of New Zealand's most respected brands. He is a highly successful businessman and has a high profile in the hunting / fishing / outdoor pursuits world.

This illustrated history of New Zealand's outstanding maritime company, the Union Steam Ship Company, attempts to bring back some of the past era. It features the most outstanding of the company's passenger ships over 85 years following the company's inception in 1875. 

The Union Steam Ship Company survived as New Zealand’s premier shipping company for 125 years, from 1875-2000. Many famous U.S.S.Co. liners and cargo ships plied the ocean routes to ports in eastern North America, the Far East, Australia, Pacific islands and of course, around the coast of New Zealand. A vital trade route was Cook Strait which linked the North Island with the South Island.

Awatea, Monowai, Niagara, Rangatira, Wahine, Hinemoa, Maori, Hawea, Wanaka, Tofua, Matua, Maunganui, Aorangi, Rotomahana, Wainui, Wairarapa were ship-names often repeated since the Company began in 1875.

At one stage the U.S.S.Co. was the largest single private employer of personnel in New Zealand.

Jack Rae gained his wings in New Zealand in 1940 and was posted to Britain as a Sergeant Pilot. He converted to Spitfires in early 1941, becoming an 'ace' and completing more than 50 operational sorties with 485 (NZ) Squadron. He was subsequently posted to Malta as part of a group of fighter pilots reinforcing the island's defenders.

In Malta Rae served with the famous 'Screwball' Beurling, Buck McNair, Ray Hesslyn, 'Laddie' Lucas and 'Jumbo' Gracey among others. At the height of the Luftwaffe's all-out onslaught designed to neutralise the island in preparation for invasion, more than 90% of the Squadron were lost to the Luftwaffe. Rae was shot down and wounded, although he recovered to fly once more. Having completed his tour of duty on the island, he was posted back to Britain joining his Squadron at the renowned Biggin Hill air base.

The same day as he was promoted to Flight Commander he was forced to crash-land his aircraft in France due to engine failure. He was captured and spent the next 20 months in prisoner-of-war camps. Most of this time was spent in Stalag Luft III, famous for the ""great escape"" in which 50 RAF officers were shot by the Gestapo after they were recaptured. Perhaps fortunately, he lost his chance to take part in this escape as he was in solitary confinement for a previous failed solo attempt.

During the bitterly cold winter of 1944-45, Rae was forced to march across Germany, fleeing from advancing Russian troops, an ordeal that killed many prisoners and guards. He managed to escape from one temporary camp but became so hungry that after a week he broke back into the camp again. He was finally freed from a camp near Bremen by advancing British troops. He ended his war service as a Flight Lieutenant awarded the DFC and Bar.

Jack Rae's account of his fighter pilot days makes compelling reading.

This is the story of Bill Hamilton

As well as giving his name to the company he founded in 1939, C.W.F.(Bill) Hamilton left a legacy of combining sound engineering practices with innovation and excellence. As a small boy he had dreamed of a boat that would carry him up the swift flowing rivers of his homeland. Such foresight was typical of this distinguished New Zealand inventor and innovator.

In 1954 his dream became a reality, and in the 50 years since the Hamilton Waterjet has revolutionised the world of conventional boating.

A humble man, Sir William often claimed that it was not he who invented the waterjet - that honour he attributed to the great mind of Archimedes. His greatest achievement was to improve the idea and make it work in the specialised field of boat propulsion.

 By Graeme Sturgeon

 River Press, Picton, 1998 First Edition Softcovered


A book about hunting in the high country of New Zealand, where the deer and wild horses still roam. It is about staying alive in the rugged isolation of the mountaintops and then in the steaming jungles of Vietnam. Most of all it is a detailed and sensitive look at what happened when Kiwi soldiers went to war, how they felt and how they fared in Vietnam, and what happened to them when they came home.

A Land Apart  The Chatham Islands of New Zealand by Michael King and Robin Morrison

For almost as long as I can remember, I have felt that there was a story to be told about the Chathams.  When I was at primary school, we were shown coloured slides of the islands and their inhabitants and wildlife by Keith Maynard, who worked at the radio station at Waitangi.  This led me to Frank Simpson's and E.C. Richards' books, published only a short time before.

The combined impression I gained was of a mysterious place where volcanic cones rose out of sea mist; where ancient people of unknown origin had left imprints on trees and rocks: where seals and seabirds inhabited a harsh coast; where sparse trees were bent  by relentless winds against bleak landscapes; where abandoned whalers trypots, stone fireplaces and whale bones preservered cameos that might have come straight from a Herman Melville novel; and where people----descendants of Moriori, Maori, sealers, whalers and missionaries---seemed a weather-beaten and as durable as the rocks and the trees.

At Home and Abroad brings together Robin Morrison's most significant work. It includes his work from England, Ireland, Australia, India and, of course, New Zealand. 'Robin Morrison's unerring eye for the quirky, the poignant, the unfashionable as well as the lonely beauties of rural landscapes and the interplay of light and shade on the land make his At Home and Abroad a book to be savoured.'North and South Robin Morrison is generally acknowledged as New Zealand's pre-eminent photographer. 

He compiled or contributed to more than 20 books in NZ, Australia and the UK, and attracted critical praise in all three countries. He won New Zealand Book Awards for The South Island from the Road in 1982, and for his major retrospective At Home and Abroad in 1992.

This is the true story of a 'splendid' brotherhood - masters and boys of Wellington College who go to the First World War. Their story is told in a scintillating series of vignettes which vividly portray their actions and emotions in the different theatres of conflict. Each vignette stems from a deep and grounded knowledge of the characters involved, what they did, who they were and where the action took place. C T McNulty's extensive use of dialouge that is crisp and real makes A Brotherhood So Splendid much more than an ""action packed"" recital of history.

McNulty understands the internal dramas his characters deal with as they face action in the field and by a singular blend of imagination and expertise he has unfolded history in the dialouge of these young men. The quintessentially 'Kiwi' character of these young men's actions is sewn deep into the sinews of the narrative. The interplay is is real, tangible and pure. This is a New Zealand story - authentically told at that critical point in time when New Zealanders stepped up, and stepped onto the world stage - thereby discovering that which made them different not only from their forebears, but from all other nations.

He was the man who, with a small dedicated team in Christchurch, designed and built from scratch the extraordinary Britten V-twin motorcycle. For a time this beautiful, revolutionary machine was probably the fastest four-stroke bike in the world, a motorcycle that could wheel stand at 150 miles per hour simply by opening up the throttle. 

After five years of research, Tim Hanna has finally been able to give due credit to the man and his achievements. This meticulously written biography details his early life, the development of his vision and the early prototype motorcycles, and then the grueling cycle of unbelievably hard work, setbacks and failures before the Britten V-twin finally was able to beat the world's best. 

His bike enthralled legions of fans worldwide, captured by the elegance, originality and power of the machine, but also by the romance of his story - an individual taking on the power and might of some of the world's biggest and best motorcycle manufacturers, and winning. John Britten is a book with appeal far beyond the motorcycling fraternity, for it has a universally inspiring theme - that extraordinary things are possible when a person can turn their dreams into reality.

Paperback with flaps  416 pp
Published by Random House 2008

In recent years scholars have argued that sexuality has a history. By this they mean that sexual identities do not express static desires unaffected by time and cultural context, but that they change as societies change. In this book I explore how what we now think of as gay male identities developed in New Zealand since the mid-nineteenth century, and examine the processes through which sex and intimate relationships between men came to reflect prevailing social circumstances. How did the gay sexual identity with which we are now familiar evolve over time?

Social institutions such as the state, religion, the media, medicine, literature, and social movements influence, but do not wholly determine, the ways in which individuals and groups have negotiated sexual identities for themselves. Society provides scripts, opportunities and constraints, and people work within these as they order and re-order their lives. In order to explore these processes in a historical context, I examine a range of sources: letters, auto/biographies, oral histories, personal papers, photographs, government reports and correspondence, medical and sex education writings, media reports, community organisation records and publications, and popular literature.

Following the discovery of gold in Otago in the early 1860's, the settlement of Dunedin quickly grew to become the largest and richest city in New Zealand. Architects came to the young city for they knew that gold meant not only mining, but growth and building. Amongst this inflow was the young Scottish born and educated architect, Robert Arthur Lawson, who, following several years working in the gold fields in Australia, entered and won a competition for the design of the First Presbyterian Church of Otago. This building was to become the most impressive of all 19th century churches in New Zealand. Lawson became more than a leading architect of the day, he was deeply involved in the management and affairs of his beloved Presbyterian Church. Over a period of just 28 years Lawson played a major role in the growth of Dunedin - taking it from a small undistinguished township to a city of remarkable and enduring Victorian architecture. The soaring spires and grand arches of Lawson's buildings captured public imagination throughout the province; his work survives in many towns in Otago and Southland. His most significant work - First Presbyterian Church of Otago, Knox Presbyterian Church, Larnach Castle, Otago Boys' High School, Dunedin Municipal Building - take their place amongst the country's most important historical buildings

The Extraordinary Young Women of the First Official Jewish Transport to Auschwitz

Books such as this are essential they remind modern readers of events that should never be forgotten - Caroline Moorehead On March 25, 1942, nearly a thousand young, unmarried Jewish women boarded a train in Poprad, Slovakia. Filled with a sense of adventure and national pride, they left their parents' homes wearing their best clothes and confidently waving good-bye. Believing they were going to work in a factory for a few months, they were eager to report for government service. Instead, the young women-many of them teenagers-were sent to Auschwitz. Their government paid 500 Reichsmarks (about £160) apiece for the Nazis to take them as slave labour. Of those 999 innocent deportees, only a few would survive. The facts of the first official Jewish transport to Auschwitz are little known, yet profoundly relevant today. These were not resistance fighters or prisoners of war. There were no men among them. Sent to almost certain death, the young women were powerless and insignificant not only because they were Jewish-but also because they were female. 

Now, acclaimed author Heather Dune Macadam reveals their poignant stories, drawing on extensive interviews with survivors, and consulting with historians, witnesses, and relatives of those first deportees to create an important addition to Holocaust literature and women's history.

 Life on a hospital ship was no pleasure cruise. Much more than a book directed at maritime or medical history buffs, The White Ships illustrates many of the war's big issues. It explores the role of government, from the relationship between the governor and his ministers to New Zealand's relationship with British officials, especially over transport allocation. On the home front, it examines community fundraising and soldier support, attitudes to alcohol, labour relations and - using private business records - the vexed question of war profits and profiteering.

Detailed and well illustrated, the text not surprisingly highlights the work of the service in both World Wars where the Chaplains gave not only their all for God, King, and Country, but also their lives. The chaplains went wherever New Zealand forces served and never shied away from the front line, doing much work to rescue and aid the wounded as well as their ""core duties"" of tending to the spiritual well-being of the troops.

A remarkable enterprise, this book is a fine tribute both to the generations of men and women who have given long and loyal service tothe newman family of nelson and to the founding brothers and the succeeding generations of Newmans who have carried the firm forward into its second century

 In 1879 the Newman brothers began a stage coach service linking Nelson, where they lived, with the township of Murchison, 60 kms away. 

They had to cope with typical South Island rugged terrain, a rough track and all the problems that climate could conjure up. However, they persisted and 100 years later they were operating extensive bus services throughout the upper half of the South Island and over most of the North Island. While this is the story of a company, its founders and their successors, historically it is typical of the many problems and challenges that faced NZ land passenger operators from stage coach to motor coach --- the Newmans were NZ pioneers for both.

Stewart served in the campaign as a pilot with the Royal Air Force flying Mark 8 Wellington aircraft.  

After training with the Royal New Zealand Air Force, he was posted overseas and joined up with the RAF.  He served with distinction as a pilot and was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross during operations in Malta. 

He has often told the story about having to ditch in the sea during the war as a result of engine failure.  Stewart and his squadron were trained for coastal command and search missions and to locate enemy shipping, including U boats.  With an engine failure an hour out from Sicily, the crew sent out a mayday call, and Stewart managed to put the Wellington down on a good sea.  

The tail touched the water and then the aircraft nose-dived and all went quiet.  “I thought at first, this is heaven.

This book provides a detailed historical and sociological context for Maori-Chinese New Zealanders concentrating on the role that schooling has played in the formation of their identity. Lee (Ngati Mahuta, Zhong Shan and Taishan Chinese) shows how racism in New Zealand's schools has impacted on members of this community. She shows that the identity of this unique cultural group is the result of a fascinating history on the margins of mainstream New Zealand society, one often intersected by racism, exclusion and colonialism. However, Maori-Chinese draw strength from their different traditions, taking pride in their unique identity while moving between the different worlds of Chinese, Maori and 'mainstream' New Zealand.

Jack MacKenzie from Manawatu Hunting and Fishing has spent A LOT of time exploring and guiding around NZ rivers so he knows his stuff. If you've ever been in the store or chatted to him then you that he's not the kind of guy to keep information to himself and is more than happy to help enable other anglers get the most out of their time on the water.

That's why it's no surprise that Jack has been quietly chipping away in the background for roughly the last 17 years working on an instructional and reference manual on flyfishing titles, ""The Tools Of Flyfishing"". No slick puffery here, just the facts devilvered in an easy to consume and straightforward manner. This is a comprehensive guide on everything from gear, casting, reading water and everything in between so if you're a new comer to fly fishing or consider yourself a seasoned vet I'm sure there's something in there for everyone.

The Gallipoli campaign was one of New Zealand's darkest and most dramatic, one that resulted in a devastating loss of life and cultivated a lasting legacy of sacrifice and nationhood.

 This carefully chosen selection from the Auckland War Memorial Museum's extensive catalogue, with many images never published before, sheds new light on New Zealand's Anzac story. Through soldiers' amateur photography - candid, unassuming, revealing and, at times, haunting - The Anzacs charts life for those who served in Gallipoli: from leaving New Zealand and encountering an unexpected landscape to the realities of combat and dealing with death and loss. 

It is a book that casts an unstinting eye on the history - and the men who lived it - presenting events as they unfolded through the photographic lens. The Anzacs is a poignant, true-life account of Gallipoli, captured by those who experienced the war and not merely observed it""--Publisher information.

 Brett Freeman

With the swift incursion of Japanese forces, 1941 early 1942 into South pacific and South East Asian areas, the shock bombing of Darwin, and the total destruction of flying boats and land based aircraft at Broome, both the RAAF and Qantas were desperate to find a secrete, southern, inland body of water where they could conceal and service their surviving flying boats. 

Lake Boga was quickly chosen. Construction of facilities commenced. Almost 1000 RAAF and WAAAF personnel were soon stationed at No. 1 Flying Boat Repair Depot, restoring RAAF Catalina, Dornier, and Martin Mariner flying boats. Having escaped the Japanese invasion of Java (Indonesia), Dutch aircraft and crews arrived, followed in mid 1943 by numbers of US Navy personnel with their 'Black Cats,' then, US Army Air Force Catalina's and crews. This intriguing story encompasses circumstances surrounding the establishment of this RAAF facility, flying boat operations, and Depot life. Readers will fly on night time operations of 20 hour duration, bombing and strafing the enemy, and on dangerous mining missions flown at masthead height. Logistical operations flown by transport aircraft are included. The reader will return to Lake Boga and discover what was achieved by dedicated personnel, living and working under difficult conditions and learn of local community support of RAAF, WAAAF, and visiting aircrew in war time

Over the years Roly Holm has entertained his family and friends with amusing and often hair-raising tales of his early working life in the King Country as a bushman, locomotive fireman and brakesman in the 1920s until the early 1940s. 
Written so that these stories would not be lost to future generations and for those who have not had the pleasure of hearing them.

It is given to few young men, particularly one not yet twenty, to be part of such a stupendous undertaking as the birth of a nation.
It was fortunate for New Zealand that Edward Jerningham Wakefield, who came from England in the Tory in 1839 as. secretary to his uncle, Colonel-William Wakefield. had a definite literary bent, for he has left us a most colourful (if sometimes one-sided) account of the beginnings of Wellington and the other New Zealand Company settlements.

His official position, inquiring mind, and an urge to see as much of this new land as possible gave young Wakefield unique opportunities to record impressions which are invaluable today.

Such prominent contemporary figures as Governor Hobson (whom he derides as “the Auckland Pasha”), Captain Fitzroy, Lieut. Willoughby Shortland, the Wakefield brothers, early explorers such as Dr Dieffen. bach and Charles Heaphy, the missionary Octavious Hadfield and the notorious Te Rauparaha and many more, pass through his pages.

Jerningham Wakefield’s book has been variously described as “a very effective piece of New Zealand Company propaganda . . . valuable for its colour and vigour . . . a remarkable production for a young man in his early twenties . . . as picturesquely enthralling as it is prejudiced.”
But, whatever its faults, the book (now reproduced by Wilson and Horton Limited, Auckland, in facsimile form*) remains for the modern reader a rich tapestry into which has been woven vivid pictures of almost every conceivable aspect of life in the first few years of the colony.

A Land Apart  The Chatham Islands of New Zealand by Michael King and Robin Morrison

For almost as long as I can remember, I have felt that there was a story to be told about the Chathams.  When I was at primary school, we were shown coloured slides of the islands and their inhabitants and wildlife by Keith Maynard, who worked at the radio station at Waitangi.  This led me to Frank Simpson's and E.C. Richards' books, published only a short time before.

The combined impression I gained was of a mysterious place where volcanic cones rose out of sea mist; where ancient people of unknown origin had left imprints on trees and rocks: where seals and seabirds inhabited a harsh coast; where sparse trees were bent  by relentless winds against bleak landscapes; where abandoned whalers trypots, stone fireplaces and whale bones preservered cameos that might have come straight from a Herman Melville novel; and where people----descendants of Moriori, Maori, sealers, whalers and missionaries---seemed a weather-beaten and as durable as the rocks and the trees.

Books written by pioneer New Zealand women from their own experiences are among the most valuable records of our country’s past. Original copies of such works are collectors’ items but, in the present facsimile series, Wilson & Horton Limited have brought* some of them within easy reach of students of social history and the reading public.

“My Simple Life in New Zealand,” written by Adela B. Stewart largely from her own diary, and published in 1908, tells part of the story of the foundation of George Vcsey Stewart’s Katikati settlement, near Tauranga.

The author, who was educated in Paris, married Vesey Stewart’s brother, Hugh, then an officer in the Royal Artillery and, for a time, led a gay social life in England, the Mediterranean and the West Indies.

Leaving behind the comforts and pleasures of the old world, Adela Stewart and her husband sailed in the Lady Jocelyn in 1878 for New Zealand. “Homesick, and depressed, also hungry,” they were not at first impressed with the district which was to be their home for the next 28 years.
But Mrs Stewart was to prove herself not only a woman of culture, but one of ability and force of character. Cheerfully and competently she entered into the hardworking role of a farmer’s wife, mastering the new skills necessary for very existence.

In 1908 the Stewarts sold “Athenree,” the gracious homestead which had become a social Centre and had given its name to the district, and returned to England. Revisiting the place which had meant so much to her, Adela Stewart died suddenly at Katikati just before the First World War.

The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron traces its origin back to the 1871 incarnation of the Auckland Yacht Club, with 30 yachts and 120 members on its register.

By then, the city had grown from a scattering of tents and shacks into a much more substantial and thriving venture, with the harbour playing a central role in its progress.

By the turn of the century, yacht racing was a thriving sport, attracting crowds of spectators and detailed reports in the local newspapers. Under the leadership of some of the city’s prominent captains of industry and commerce, the AYC showed continued growth.

For weeks in Antarctica, Douglas Mawson faced some of the most daunting conditions ever known to man: blistering wind, snow, and cold; the loss of his companion, dogs, supplies, and even the skin on his hands and feet. But despite constant thirst, starvation, disease, and snow blindness--he survived.

Sir Douglas Mawson is remembered as the young Australian who would not go to the South Pole with Robert Scott in 1911. Instead, he chose to lead his own expedition on the less glamorous mission of charting nearly 1,500 miles of Antarctic coastline and claiming its resources for the British Crown. His party of three set out through the mountains across glaciers in 60-mile-per-hour winds. Six weeks and 320 miles out, one man fell into a crevasse--along with the tent, most of the equipment, the dogs' food, and all except a week's supply of the men's provisions.

John Pascoe has presented a lively yet concise regional history of the Haast

His writing has covered all its aspects, and his journeys by car and on foot have enabled him to photograph much of the country whose story he has related.

 He has broken much new ground in research- notably, about the Haast-Cameron controversy, the early, ill-fated settlement at Jackson Bay, and the growth of the Haast Pass road from prospector's trails to pack-track and then to fully-bridged highway. 

He has delved in the files of the Immigration Department, in provincial records, and in the archives of the Ministry of Works, from the 1870's onwards. This is a human story of floods and privations, isolation and courage; it mirrors the search for prosperity, the relief works of the Depression, the impact of two world wars, and the final triumph of surveyors, workmen and engineers. 

The narrative is splendidly illustrated by historical and contemporary photographs, and an impressive list of source documents the solid basis on which the book has been written

 A. H. Reed, Wellington, 1974, hardback with dustjacket, 168 pages, illustrated nautical history

On 14 May 1866 the General Grant, sailing from Melbourne to London, hit cliffs on the west coast of the main island in the subantarctic Auckland Islands. Of the 83 people on board, 15 eventually made it ashore at Port Ross at the northern end of Auckland Island.

The castaways had little more than the clothes they stood up in. Faced with endless rain and bitter, cold winds, their ability to make a fire would be crucial to their survival. An account of the wreck describes how a survivor watched in dismay as five of their six matches were squandered:

‘This was the most critical moment of our lives. If the last match failed, starvation and perhaps cannibalism were to be our lot.’ One of the men dried the last match against his body. ‘I saw his hands tremble as he looked for a dry stone on which to strike the remaining match. He struck it with trembling fingers and the flame caught the dry grass. We all uttered, “Thanks be to God”: it was the most fervent prayer I ever said.’ The fire, once lit, was never allowed to expire.

To survive, the castaways grew potatoes and caught wild pigs using iron hooks. They also domesticated pigs and goats.

After nine months, four of the crew set out in a small boat for Bluff, more than 500 km away. They were never seen again.

The first 66 years of the history of this church were recorded in the substantial book From One
Generation to Another: the story of the church in Kiwitea since the early eighties. Its author, John
Frederick Mayo, was a former vicar with the Parochial District of Kiwitea, whose connection with the
district dated from 1905. He died just before it was published in 1956. This then leaves the last 55
years of the church’s life (to date) to be discovered in order to present its full story.
Mayo wrote that in 1876, the government offered for sale the land (24,000 acres) that includes the
church site. The ‘Township of Kiwitea’ (750 acres) was offered for sale in 1877 – however the
‘Township’ was never laid out. In 1884, Kiwitea School was opened on Perry’s Line, two miles from
the ‘Township site. This new location was known as Kiwitea Corner. A community hall and a post
office store were established there at an early time.1

church architect, Frederick de Jersey Clere – was to become the ‘Mother Church’ of the Kiwitea",FALSE,,TRUE,28.00,28.00,42.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL;14.00=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL ONLY;2.00=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;0.0=Pick up No Cost Or Combined Shipping;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2024-06-07 20.52.46.jpg;2024-06-07 20.51.22.jpg;2024-06-07 20.51.36.jpg;2024-06-07 20.51.50.jpg;2024-06-07 20.51.58.jpg;2024-06-07 20.52.18.jpg;2024-06-07 20.52.21.jpg;2024-06-07 20.53.01.jpg;2024-06-07 20.53.26.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"Week 5",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

If you know your Hori you will be in step with the title; if you don't you won't read far before stumbling over his first half-Gallon jar.

Hori's world is not big, but it's full of fun. In addition to Hori himself, its principal characters are his wife, his mother in law, his brother in law and “the pakeha joker from up the street,” though other lesser characters make their brief appearances.

If at times Hori appears unreasonably hard on such people as car salesmen, traffic cops and politicians, he's only having his bit of fun. He's a well-fed, happily married, easy going Maori who gets on well with everyone and asks only to be allowed to tinker with his old V8, to sit and meditate while watching the oxalis grow, to eat his favorite crayfish claws, pigs' trotters and mussels and to drain his half gallon jar at the weekends.

A fair question would be whether Hori is really a Maori. He is not. In real life he is W. Norman McCallum of Waiatarua Road, Remuera, Auckland, a New Zealander of Scottish Descent. As a commercial traveler in the North Auckland and Waikato districts for many years he made countless firm friends among the Maori people, and his admiration of “the first New Zealanders” is unbounded.

Contemporary creative writers, intellectuals, photographers, painters and other artists have all contributed to this volume exploring the idea of 'gothic' in New Zealand culture. From Martin Edmond's abandoned houses, to Ian Lochhead's Victorian corrugated iron structures, to Otis Frizzell's tattoos, from Peter Jackson's movie-making to ghost paintings – there's plenty of it. As the editors suggest, gothic is 'endemic to New Zealand's self-representation'.

The book grew out of the editors' teaching and research following an 'Antipodean Gothic' conference at Massey University, Albany, in 2002. They have extended their interests beyond the literary or strictly academic, taking in NZ culture in a broad sense.

Peter Graham's service as head guide at the Hermitage, Mount Cook, coincided with the 1st flowering of New Zealand Alpine climbing, 1894 -- 1928. He made many 1st climbs of the great peaks of the Central Southern Alps and he's alone earned him a great name in New Zealand mountaineering; but his work as a professional guide, founding a tradition of care and safe conduct in the parties he led, is an equally important contribution to the sport

 Handsome, young and debonair, with the common touch, he was a successful minister in the early 1920s and seemed full of promise when he became Prime Minister in 1925 on the death of W.F. Massey. 

Ten years later, after serving as Minister of Finance in the Coalition Government during the Depression, his reputation has sunk to its lowest ebb. He went on to serve with distinction in the War Cabinet, winning the confidence and respect of his Labour colleagues. 

Dying suddenly in 1943, he left behind many friends and supporters, who to this day regard him as one of New Zealand's political giants.

Although written as fiction, this is more of a dramatised account of the history of the Chinese in New Zealand. 

By following the lives and fortunes of the Oon family, Kang manages to include almost every major event of Chinese New Zealand history from 1860 up to 1940. Beginning with Oon Ho's departure from his home village, the story follows the slow transition from being a guest in New Zealand to calling it home.

The National Grid is a vital part of New Zealand's infrastructure. Without Transpower's substations, transmission equipment, control centres and the people who manage them, the country could not function in the 21st century. 

Connecting the Country tells the story of the early engineers, surveyors, linemen and operators and describes how their commitment to 'keep the lights on' is still central to the ethos of those who run the national grid today.

THE dust jacket gives a plane’s-eye look at ‘the heart of Fiordland’, majestic and primeval scenery that has an overpowering impact on
the air sightseer. Down in the rainforest and glacier-hewn valleys the effect is more subtle: trampers, hunters and tourists can become so
drawn to the country that they must return again and again. The author came under the spell of Fiordland, and this book is an entertaining account of his adventures as bushman, tourist guide, launch skipper, and as worker on the vast Manapouri-Deep Cove hydroelectric project.
George Howard first went to the Doubtful Sound country to work on the tourist track leading over the Wilmot Pass to Deep Cove, the easternmost tip of the Sound. A tourist company had a hostel beside the Lyvia River in Deep Cove, the base for visitors to be taken
on spectacular launch and land ‘trips round Doubtful Sound.
The tranquility was to be shattered. West Arm of Lake Manapouri became a bustling township as construction work for the underground power station gathered speed the former trans Tasman liner Wanganella sailed into Deep Cove to be used as a hostel for workers piercing the tail race tunnel under the mountains to West Arm; and a road was bull- dozed over the Wilmot Pass. Howard’s story is about the place and the people: men like himself who couldn’t resist the bush life and the men of many creeds and nationalities who came to work on the power scheme. The description of the unusual community in the Wanganella is of particular interest.

The 1808 'Rum' Rebellion
On 26th January 1808, officers and men of the New South Wales Corps marched to Government House in Sydney in an act of rebellion against Governor William Bligh.


Bligh was arrested and the colony was placed under military rule. This was the only time in Australian history that a government was overthrown by a military coup.

The military stayed in power for two years until Lachlan Macquarie, the fifth Governor of NSW, assumed office at the beginning of 1810. The overthrow of Bligh much later became known as the ‘Rum Rebellion’ because the NSW Corps was heavily involved in the trade in rum in the colony and was nicknamed the ‘Rum Corps’. The term 'Rum Rebellion' was not used at the time. The factors leading up to Bligh’s arrest had much less to do with the rum trade and much more to do with a battle for power between the military and civil elites of the colony and the Governor.",FALSE,,TRUE,14.00,14.00,18.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL;14.00=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL ONLY;2.00=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;0.0=0;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2024-06-16 09.42.02.jpg;2024-06-16 09.42.12.jpg;2024-06-16 09.42.29.jpg;2024-06-16 09.42.34.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"MAIN STOCK",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

Part of our national character, many of these buildings were designed by six men who held the post of Colonial or Government Architect from the 1860s to 1960s. This book brings together all of their surviving public works, with drawings illustrating the distinctive style of design and particular brilliance of each.

The period takes the reader from colonialism to modernism. Buildings from all over the country are included.

A Biography of Andreas Reischek Early New Zealand Explorer & Collector By M King

The Australian naturalist Andreas Reischek (1845-1902), author of the classic Yesterdays in Maoriland, came to New Zealand in 1877 for two years and stayed for twelve. 

He returned to Vienna in 1889 with the last great collection of artifacts and natural specimens to be taken to Europe from the South Seas - 14,000 items. 

After a brief moment of glory he died in poverty and obscurity. He has been hailed by some as one of New Zealand's great explorers and scientists, and he has been vilified by others as an accomplished charlatan who bribed and cheated his way through the Antipodes.

 The author, Michael King has set out to provide a lucid and balanced evaluation of his life and work.

Selections from Early New Zealand Writing 
By Cherry A. Hankin (Author) 1981

VG condition  287 pages


Life in a Young Colony is a selection of extracts from the records and memoirs of some forty different British men and women who came to New Zealand in the nineteenth century. The pieces chosen illustrate the gradual development of settled life in the young colony and have been arranged in a sequence that is thematic and roughly chronological. The interest of this anthology is not just historical, however: most of the extracts have been chosen because they tell a good story. Indeed, what we see in much of this factual recording of daily events-with embellishment-is the genesis of realistic New Zealand fiction. F. E. Maning, for example, caught up in the tale of his 'old rangatira', was not trying to write fiction. But he shaped and heightened his material so as to give it the maximum impact. Edwin Hodder clearly had a mischievous eye on the susceptibilities of his readers when he described the shipboard trick played on the hapless spinster, Amelia, and her suitor. Sarah Courage's cleverly presented story of the trials of country housekeeping actually prefigures the fictional treatment later accorded farming life by, amongst others, her own descendant, James Courage.

""I'd been perusing him for about 20 years ... I found out just about everything about him except who he actually was.""

Mr Andrews said the book took 10 years to complete, in between working on other books such as a history of Ngongotaha.

This edition 1988 Reed Edition

Ssoftcover; 160 pages w/ b/w photos, map & index. 25cmx18.5cm. 

Around the north-east of the Kaippara harbour author Dick Scott encountered the remarkable histories of seven families who had been in close contact with the Ngati Whatua during the early days of European settlement. 

In Seven Lives On Salt River he seeks out to find out who these people were, what beliefs they brought with them from Europe and how they adapted to a new land. 

Each family, in some way, left it's mark, like the Blackwells who were largely responsible for the botanical classic, Laing and Blackwells Plants of New Zealand. W Heathcote Jackman, the first successful grower of classic grapes - a success that owed something to his use of ground Maori bones for fertiliser.... 

Winner of the 1988 NZ Book Award 

But beyond the achievements and legacies of the families, it is the details of how they interacted with their new land and its Maori inhabitants that gives this book its fascination. It features more than 100 previously unpublished photos.

A pictorial smorgasbord of 176 photographs of Wellington streets as they grew and developed through the 20th century. A book of discovery for those who did not live in the days when trams ruled the streets of Wellington and, for others, a wonderful look back in time to those days, with many memories of the city and suburbs and the personalities of the different decades.

 Graham Stewart has brought together a unique collection of photographs, over 80 taken by himself in the early 1950s and never published before, of Wellington before the arrival of the modern city we know today. This is a timely book which records the century and shows graphically how Wellington has grown since 1900. It is full of nostalgia, showing the pioneer buildings, the street furniture of the past, the shops, the fashions. It is a fascinating ride back in time which will interest Wellingtonian's and everyone who has a special affection for this gem of a hilly city with so much to offer its citizens and visitors

The gripping story of an iconic New Zealand high country sheep station in the heart of the South Island's MacKenzie Country. There are two ways into the MacKenzie Country: via Fairlie and Burke's Pass or over the Lindis. Whichever way you drive, when you enter the MacKenzie you know you are somewhere very different and very special. It's a huge basin surrounded by sere hills, it's dry as a bone, and it feels somehow ancient. The sky is a wide blue dome. In spring lupins blaze in the roadside ditches. In winter those hills are dusted with snow. It feels as timeless and untouched as the Maniototo, and as empty. This is where James McKenzie filched his sheep from the squattocrats, stealing through the night with his clever dog. This is where the night sky is so dark that it's now protected under world heritage status. This is where battles have been fought over irrigation and water rights. This is where, on Glenmore Station, which runs up one side of Lake Tekapo all the way to the boundary with Mount Cook National Park, the Murrays have farmed for 100 years and four generations.

Cardcovered  published 2013

Winner of the 2014 New Zealand Post Book Awards Book of the Year.

From Montana award-winning author Jill Trevelyan comes the first biography of Peter McLeavey, the charismatic, pioneering art dealer who since the 1960s has shaped – even transformed – New Zealand art.

Over the past half-century, Peter McLeavey has known, exhibited, befriended, fought with and championed a who’s who of New Zealand artists. Now, for the first time, he has granted exclusive access to his private papers to award-winning biographer Jill Trevelyan, author of Rita Angus: An Artist’s Life.

Delving into McLeavey’s extensive and hitherto untapped archive of letters, diaries, exhibition files and more, this book offers insights into the artists McLeavey has represented across half a century. Here, in their own words – lively, salty, and often heart-breaking – are Colin McCahon, Toss Woollaston, Len Lye, Milan Mrkusich, Michael Smither, Gordon Walters, Michael Illingworth, Don Driver, Robin White, John Reynolds, Yvonne Todd and many more.

McLeavey’s personal story is remarkable, but in reading it, his contemporaries will recognise common and timeless themes: the religious upbringing, the struggle to be bohemian in small-town New Zealand, the challenges of marriage and fatherhood, the dilemma of whether to stay or leave New Zealand, and the need to make a mark.

Stewart’s work documents the changes in the four main centers and in cities like New Plymouth, Whanganui, and Invercargill, which had established electric tramway services in the early 20th century2. It’s a nostalgic look at a significant period in New Zealand’s transport history.

This book takes the reader on a journey into the colourful world of the picture postcard during World War One when the form of communicating was to mail a postcard with a message on the reverse side to a loved one serving on the battlefields of Europe. 

They were the emails of yesteryear, the economic way to communicate with family and friends across the miles. When war was declared in 1914, postcards took on a more meaningful purpose on a scale not seen before. Beyond their heart-filled personal messages to and from the battlefront, postcards also became a patriotic and propaganda tool. 

The Dominion of New Zealand was quick to rally and answer the call to serve King and Country and it was not long before New Zealand publishers were producing original works by New Zealand artists and photographers for the local market. 

They were cherished as prized possessions for their photographs and art and became collectables in private postcard collections. These wonderful and thought provoking postcards with their handwritten messages give a poignant insight into the life and times in New Zealand during the Great War....

A fascinating insight into the story behind New Zealand's internationally renowned tourist jet boat venture which launched Queenstown's adventure tourism industry in 1965 and has thrilled over three million passengers in its first half century of operation. Jet boating arrived in New Zealand in the 1950s with the invention of the Hamilton jet unit by pioneer CWF (Bill) Hamilton. Tourism pioneers quickly identified the potential in Queenstown for commercial jet boating and in 1965 the Shotover Jet Boat Service Ltd was launched. During the following 50 years the trip through narrow and challenging Shotover Canyons has developed into a flagship New Zealand tourist activity - billed as the ""world's most exciting jet boat ride"". Shotover Jet has attracted many celebrities and received the royal stamp of approval and worldwide exposure when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rode the canyons during their 2014 New Zealand tour. This book is more than just a story about a high profile tourist jet boat company - it is a captivating history reflecting the indomitable New Zealand pioneering spirit and early risk taking tourism entrepreneurs.

In the 1930s the New Zealander Jack Lovelock was one of the world's best-known athletes. In 1933 he broke the world record for the mile. At the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games he won a gold medal and broke the world record for the 1500 metres. When he retired, a leading sports writer lamented the end of a golden age of mile racing. Throughout his running career Lovelock kept journals and diaries. Other athletes have collected photographs, clippings and memorabilia, and many have kept training diaries, but few, if any, have had the inclination to write about their sport quite as he did. While much has been written about Lovelock, until now his journals and diaries have never been published. As If Running on Air reproduces his journals from late 1931 to the end of 1935 and extracts from his 1936 training diary. An entry appears for every race. Some are brief, little more than notes; others are eloquent and reflective. Collectively they constitute a unique record of a sporting life in the 1930s and offer insights into just what it took to make a world champion. An introduction provides an overview of his life, a description of his albums, journals and diaries, and a discussion of the various myths and legends about him. The journal entries for each year are prefaced by a short explanatory essay providing some more detailed sporting background. Interspersed are short biographical sketches of those who helped make this such a great era of middle-distance racing. At the end is an essay about his training methods, and a full race list. The book is illustrated almost entirely with photographs and cartoons from Lovelock's own albums.

`In the year 1879 there was touring this country the Rev. J. Berry, an agent for the New Zealand Government. He extolled the virtues of that country and advised people to emigrate to New Zeland and there make their fortunes. John Hillary, a shopkeeper in the small north-eastern town of Tow Law, listened to the blandishments of the reverend gentleman and being sure that only truth could come from such a source, decided that as New Zealand must be `the promised land' he would act upon the advice given.'
The diary, reproduced exactly as written with comments added by the present John Hillary, paints a vivid and absorbing picture of the life and adventures of emigrants over 100 years ago, both on board ship and in the depression in New Zealand at that time.

Living as a poor student should, money was always a limiting factor. Harvesting meat was reason enough to spend every last dollar on petrol to head out of Christchurch into the hills. Most of the more than 100 hunting trips undertaken in those three years started with a note or a txt passed between mates during a boring lecture where a wandering mind always ended up in the hills, much the same as it still does today. ""Hunting is in my blood, always has been. Ever since I can remember I have hunted however I could. 

My earliest memories of hunting are memories I share with my Grandad. I would join him whenever the opportunity arose to go and shoot a rabbit or trap cats and ferrets in the haysheds scattered around the family farm I grew up on. ""During my high school years I was introduced to big game hunting which sparked a love for not only the animals but the adventure, places and people I met wherever my hobby took me. 

My time was never more mine, and never more invested into hunting as it was recently when I found myself at university; organising my own way in the world. I enjoyed my days as a student living like no other period of my life and I am glad I made the most of it. 

Recording the hunting I did in those years has been a great project because although the memories are fresh now, I know once life in the real world kicks in they will fade into only distant dreams of a past life."".",FALSE,,TRUE,12.00,12.00,16.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;14.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;1.0=Postage after paying full post on the first item;2.0=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;0.0=Pick up No Cost;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2024-07-28 19.34.05.jpg;2024-07-28 19.34.13.jpg;2024-07-28 19.34.32.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"week 11",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

Compulsory Military training and National Service in NZ 1949 to 1972.  

What do Colin Meads and Carmen have in common? Or Barry Brickell, Jim Bolger, John Hawkesby, Paul Reeves and Witi Ihimaera? They all took part in compulsory military training (CMT). 

Just four years after the greatest war the planet had witnessed, New Zealand thought it was going to have to do it all again. As the Cold War brewed over ideology and atom bombs, New Zealand determined to play its part in collective security. 

People argued over how to raise the necessary force but the country willingly adopted Compulsory Military Training. Young men were registered, examined and forced to learn basic Army, Navy or Air Force skills. In this ground-- breaking study, military historian Peter Cooke follows these men through the process of being given a number, called up and regimented. 

The voices of over 830 trainees are heard as they fill out Labour Department forms, try for a postponement and shuffle into barracks. We witness them getting shouted at, broken -- and begrudging the discipline, discomfort and NCOs. 

But then over three months we see them emerging as confident, disciplined cogs in a machine. In almost a quarter century, around 100,000 young New Zealand men were trained in CMT and National Service. 

This was felt to be essential at the time and, thankfully, the men were never sent to war. Instead, they came out of it with something unexpected, something they've harbored for life - and were keen to reveal.

Encyclopedia of Punk clearly proves, punk music and culture has produced a rich trove of material, above and beyond the hundreds of bands, from books and films to incendiary political movements. 

When people think of punk they often think of outrageous fashion and iconic bands like The Ramones and the Sex Pistols. But the reality of punk stretches over three decades and numerous countries, with a history as rich and varied as it is shocking and daring. 

With this lavishly illustrated and authoritative A-Z guide, Brian Cogan leads readers through the fiery history of a furious, rebellious, contradictory and boundary-redefining musical genre and cultural movement that remains as massively influential as it is wildly misunderstood.

Using information on individual ships, voyages and passengers, author David Hastings follows the narrative of the voyage and the way in which the space on the ship was allotted according to gender, class and marital status. He then explores the social dynamics on board dealing with the routines of daily life, crime, mutiny, health, religion and an interesting chapter on ‘the virgins’ cage’ where the single women were confined. He convincingly shows the ship as a microcosm of the society British migrants brought to these islands. 

Over the Mountains of the Sea is generously illustrated with photographs, sketches and magazine illustrations. It will be warmly welcomed by genealogists, professional historians and the many New Zealanders who enjoy reading about our history.

BEFORE ANZAC, BEYOND ARMISTICE is a new approach to the First World War. Using the soldiers' service files - a valuable source so far largely ignored by historians - Keith Scott presents a keyhole study of the character, background, fortunes and fate of the men from Central Otago who went to war together. 

Woven through the research are personal stories of, and encounters with, war told by the soldiers themselves: shared experiences of fun, endurance, death and, most importantly of all, mateship. 

This is also a story of the home from which these soldiers came: before, during and after war. It is a community that is determined yet divided. Scott reveals the fear behind the flag waving and the anger that followed the anguish. These soldiers and their community will charm you, challenge you - and change you.

This is the story of the newspaper correspondence column Dot's Little Folk and those who wrote to it. Little Folk was the first correspondence column for children in a New Zealand newspaper. It became the largest feature column of any kind in the history of New Zealand journalism, and it gave rise to a social and literary movement among this country's youth, that can only be called a culture. 'Dear Dot, I was six years old this birthday. I had a party with a cake and icing. Mamma is helping me write this. I have three sisters, two cats and a canary. I had little brother, but the angels took him to live with them in Heaven. Why did they do that Dot? Anyway, I must tell you about ...' 'Dear Dot, I will be sixteen this birthday. Mamma tells me I am now to put my hair up and wear long skirts. I do not want to, but Mamma insists. Why does she do that Dot? Anyway, I must tell you about ...' 

The letters to Dot go over 50 and more years. They record the triumphs and tragedies of everyday lives. They are the thoughts and feelings of children, teenagers, and young adults in late the 19th and the early 20th century. They present a Personal History of New Zealanders, from the back blocks of the country, the streets of the cities, to the trenches on the battle fields of France. These are the lives and the voices of our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents when they were young.

Bainbridge had long been looking forward to his trip to the New Zealand thermal region and on June 5th coached to Ohinemutu in Rotorua. On Sunday the 6th of June a party of six including Bainbridge left Rotorua for Wairoa en route for the terraces. On Monday morning Bainbridge made his way from Wairoa to Rotomahana. Bainbridge was to stay at Joseph McRae's Rotomohana Hotel where he was the only guest as it was mid winter (off season). 

During his stay in Rotomahana, Bainbridge visited the Pink and White terraces with guide Sophia and went pheasant shooting with Joseph McRae the hotel owner. Bainbridge and his group were the last tourists to visit the terraces.

At around one in the morning on June 10, 1886, earthquakes began to rattle doors, shake furniture and awaken the residents at Te Wairoa. Residents observed in awe at the dense black cloud that rose above the glow, lit by a tremendous display of sheet and forked lightning, flashing above the peaks of Tarawera.

Observing the spectacle, but from a vantage point by the church, were Joseph McRae (Rotomahana Hotel owner), with 20 year old Edwin Bainbridge, his solitary guest.

Bainbridge died tragically when the veranda of the Rotomahana Hotel collapsed on him.

‘Burnham Camp! It has been hated by thousands of men. It has been loved by thousands of men. And there are many”, say the authors of this book, “who have hated it and loved it almost at the same time.

How many? Well, some 47,000 trained here in World War another 22,000 entered in 1950-8 for CMT; National
Service added 8000 in 1961-72; and a further 1500 served in Korea, and 5000 in Malaya, Borneo and South Vietnam.
The book may well be unique as the first full history of an Army camp, and some things could come as a surprise to those who think they know the place. The story of the infamous Bumham Industrial School, for instance, from which the camp grew a few of its grim Victorian buildings survive today. Few will be aware that Burnham was one of the sites chosen for observing the transit of Venus across the face of the sun in 1874 and 1882, or that the little garrison church is said to be the oldest rural church on the Canterbury Plains.
The growth of Burnham Camp, especially the rush building programme that began the day before war was declared in September 1939, is impressive, but it is the human side that gives the book its greatest appeal such as the chapter by Charles Upham, VC and Bar, who arrived as a recruit in the hurly-burly days at start of World War or the recollections of Jean Stanbury who served at Burnham as a WRAC from 1943 to 1970. And Nelson, the wartime mascot, is not forgotten.
Second NZEF units, Jayforce, Kayforce, Malaya battalions; CMT, National Service, and the new Territorial
Volunteer intakes they are all here, plus a comprehensive chronology, Camp Commandants, and brief histories of all units now at Burnham.

The story of Keith Murdoch is the great unsolved mystery of world rugby. The All Black who was sent home from the tour of the British Isles in 1972 and who exiled himself to the vastness of the Australian outback remains a banner headline in rugby memories.

 It does so despite the passing of the years. The basics of the story are well known: the strength of the man who scored the All Blacks' only try against Wales, then the celebrations that night that went so horribly wrong. 

Murdoch has appeared publicly a few times since but not said much and nothing at all of the events of that night, or how he felt then and later.

 But now, the story can be told more fully than before through anecdotes and memories of teammates and colleagues and through the damning words of those who condemned him to his life on the run.

From Tauranga to the Trenches told the story of Private Reginald Watkins, a Tauranga man who led ‘an ordinary yet remarkable life’. In telling Reg’s story the remarkable lives of all those local men who served, some of whom never returned home, were told.

Reginald Watkins was a son and a brother. He was a Captain in the Salvation Army, a farmer and a fisherman. He was a fine sailor and owned a launch. He loved photography, taking and developing his own photographs and turning them into postcards for his collection. He spoke fluent Maori and lived and worked on Rangiwaea Island, his home was often a tent at Rangiwaea Pa.

When war was declared Reg had been living in Tauranga since 1911, the second of two spells assisting Captain Moore with Salvation Army work. His days were spent visiting and encouraging Maori families in his care, leading them in worship, and working beside them at the Te Ope Fish and Bacon Factory at Sulphur Point. He was by all accounts a quiet and thoughtful young man who was “held in great esteem” by all who knew him.

For Reg the decision to enlist was a difficult one. He wrote to Commissioner Hodder of the Salvation Army: “I am the only one free in our family who is able to volunteer for the war, and my people regard it as a stigma upon the family that they are not represented.” On 18 October 1915 Private Watkins signed the Oath of Allegiance and promised obedience under the Defence Act.",FALSE,,TRUE,18.00,18.00,22.00,FALSE,FALSE,,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL;14.00=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;2.00=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;0.00=Pick up No Cost Or Combined Shipping;11.0=P O Box Inc Waiheke Island and Stewart Island;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2024-08-07 19.53.38.jpg;2024-08-07 19.53.59.jpg;2024-08-07 19.54.05.jpg;2024-08-07 19.54.35.jpg;2024-08-07 19.54.51.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"week 7",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

They will be delighted to become reacquainted with our wrestling heroes of sixty years ago and recall with affection the wonderful freedom experienced by growing boys of these times.

Delving Deeper is a comprehensive chronicle of the discovery of world class adventure caving in New Zealand. Most of this has happened since the NZ Speleological Society was formed in 1949.

 Outdoor and armchair enthusiasts will enjoy the tales of challenge and discovery, as natural history and Maori lore entwine with the pioneering spirit of New Zealanders. This is a continuing saga as the cavers of today strive for two big milestones - 100km length and 1,000 metres in depth.

New Zealander Newcombe had come to Europe on an overseas adventure, finding a home in West Berlin working as an engineer for Konig, the outboard and hydroplane specialists. Newcombe became the test rider. Newcombe subsequently won the Yugoslavian GP and topped the 500GP table. 

Then came Silverstone. Newcombe's achievements were singular and remarkable and his story offers an unique insight into the world of grand prix racing in the early seventies.

Rohan has picked up where Tolkien left off and then some. He has a sure touch with the mythology of Northern Europe, handles the high style beautifully, and in the smithcraft of his protagonist finds a fresh metaphor for magic.""


The Winter of the World stories are set in a strange and hostile time, one of the eras when the Great Ice spread out yet again from the polar caps, seeking to engulf the world in its chill grip and scour it clean of contaminating life - and most of all the first, and long forgotten, civilizations of men. But, as the Winter Chronicles record, men were not wholly without friends; and they found in themselves strange and magical abilities to help them survive and keep the lights burning against the encroaching dark. Greatest among these was the working of metal to arcane effect, the power of smithcraft; and the men in whom that power burned fiercest of all became the source of many legends, the Mastersmiths of the Northlands.

This program, established under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, aimed to modernize and expand the U.S. merchant fleet by constructing 500 ships over a ten-year period. The initiative was crucial for bolstering the U.S. maritime industry and ensuring a robust merchant marine capable of supporting both commerce and national defense.
The book, published in 1979, is part of a series that explores the evolution of shipbuilding in the United States. It includes details about the types of ships built, the challenges faced during the program, and its impact on the maritime industry.

This issue discusses the Māori First World War memorial at Whanganui, seen to symbolise the complex legacy of colonisation on the way the war was remembered and on society's recognition of Māori roles. And it highlights the war diary of musician Oliver Foote to depict the ambivalence felt by entertainers in the context of battle.

Grand Old Days of Steam by W. W. Stewart. ""The steam locomotive,"" writes W. W. (Bill) Stewart ""was the most human machine invented by man"" - the reason no doubt why those ""iron horses"" stirred so many imaginations during their time on earth and, since their general demise, have left so many memories.

 To a far greater degree than achieved by any other means of mechanical transport the steam locomotive became an integral part of life for several generations of New Zealanders during the nineteenth and much of the present century. It carried them to school and work, transported them on holidays and to distant relations, and, most importantly, served to bring the country closer together, joining town and country.

Bob ""Roberto"" Rogers, was harboured by Vignoni's late great-grandparents, Giuseppe and Iolanda Manessi, in the Italian village of Gaina for more than six months during World War II.


Rogers served in North Africa with the British Army but was captured by the Germans when his position was over-run by tanks.

He was one of 3000 Allied prisoners-of-war bound for Italy aboard the cargo ship MV Nino Bixio when it was torpedoed twice by a Royal Navy submarine.

Although the number of casualties was high, the ship didn't sink and survivors were moved to Italian prisoner-of-war camps.

 Rogers was sent to PG 70 in Monturano.

Eventually Rogers escaped north to the small village of Gaina, near Brescia, the German headquarters for Italy during the war, and close to the Swiss border.

He was ""adopted"" by the Manessi family who risked their own lives to hide Rogers. They made him one of their own, dressing him in civvies and teaching him Italian.

He eventually reached freedom in Switzerland, later returning to his home town of Tyneside in north-east England and moving to New Zealand in 1958, settling in Palmerston North.

Rogers who died in 2010, aged 89 penned an autobiography called Sixty bonus years; a tale of survival

Stewart served in the campaign as a pilot with the Royal Air Force flying Mark 8 Wellington aircraft.  

After training with the Royal New Zealand Air Force, he was posted overseas and joined up with the RAF.  He served with distinction as a pilot and was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross during operations in Malta. 

He has often told the story about having to ditch in the sea during the war as a result of engine failure.  Stewart and his squadron were trained for coastal command and search missions and to locate enemy shipping, including U boats.  With an engine failure an hour out from Sicily, the crew sent out a mayday call, and Stewart managed to put the Wellington down on a good sea.  

The tail touched the water and then the aircraft nose-dived and all went quiet.  “I thought at first, this is heaven.  My co-pilot and I got up out of the aircraft and stepped onto a life raft without even getting wet”.  They were fortunately rescued by an allied ship and within a few days were back on active service.

Charlie started flying in 1971 in an old Auster doing
venison recovery mainly around the Kawekas and
Kaimanawas. The problem with the Auster was that it
finally ran out of hours, so he built his own low wing Jodel.
“I flew that for a few years, until I went down south, where
I decided I needed a high wing. So I got another Auster,
put a V8 engine in it with the blessing of Civil Aviation, and
flew that for a while. But soon after I flew straight into court
because I didn’t actually ask them if I could use it in the air.
That thing ran like a Swiss watch: started instantly, used no
oil, and half as much fuel as the original – a real dream. Not
conventional, but it worked beautifully. One Civil Aviation
turkey even said to me that I’d rip my wings off! So I had to
get rid of it. I stopped the venison recovery in the mid ‘80’s.
In the end I was doing it just to keep the plane working, but
it was better than standing on a street corner busking. I did
it for while with horses, but that required three-times more
work. Then I built a jet boat, but found the Mohaka River
was full of real rocks, not rubber rocks, so the insurance
company quickly told me to go away. I built a gyrocoptor,
but after one trial flight I was too scared to continue, so

A Splendid Isolation is a beautifully illustrated reference book chock-full of stories that detail the history of the Gisborne East Coast district from 1950 until 2012.

 The first major history of the region since J A Mackay's Historic Poverty Bay and the East Coast of 1949, A Splendid Isolation is framed by five sections titled Rugged, Isolated, Fertile, Connected and Spirited to reflect the essence of the region and its people. The book begins with the power of the land, and charts the many challenges that successive groups and governing bodies have tackled - from erosion, flooding and earthquakes to the development of the region's infrastructure. 

 A Splendid Isolation celebrates the fertility of the land and sea, the way kinship and long-term commitment have built economic and social success, and the way the people of the region have used leisure activities - from kapa haka and the arts to sports on water and land - to build a collective spirit. From Abel to Zwart, from A & P Shows to yachting

 A Splendid Isolation features hundreds of people and more than 1,300 photographs over its 520 pages. Preface by Dame Anne Salmond

They got permission from the former Lands and Survey department to use a block of land by Nairn Street — now Wilcox Green — once Jimmy Cowie had dug his spud crop.

They bulldozed out a rink which opened in June 1954.

""It brought Arrowtown alive — the first weekend, there were buses from Invercargill, people from all over the place.""
In the book, then-school headmaster Russell Styles, whose job had been saved and who still lives in Arrowtown, recalls that in the 1960s the entire physical education syllabus in the second term consisted of skating.

Lights were installed and music from tape decks reverberated around town.

The skating club brought over instructors from Australia to teach figure skating.

Ice shows and championships, including even the New Zealand champs, were hosted.

Nairn St was populated by out-of-town cribbies who took their families skating at the weekend.

Hamilton also reports the rink’s demise, as volunteer numbers dwindled and skiing took over.

He’s pulled together his self-published book using many of his own photos and others from Arrowtown’s Lakes District Museum.
Many former young skaters provided stories and photos.

A practical book on the training and management of sheep dogs 

The smooth, efficient movement of flocks of sheep is an integral part of the great chain of pastoral activity which supplies wool to the mills and meat to the food shops around the world.

 The sheep dog plays a part on the assembly line of this industry which is second only to that of the flock masters and shepherds themselves. Indeed it might well be claimed that the value of well trained dogs 
matches, if it does not actually exceed, that of the men behind them.

A History Don Grady 238 Pgs Indexed

The Perano Whalers of Cook Strait, 1911-1964 By Don Grady.

 1982. FIRST EDITION.



The Perano family operated shore whaling stations inside the narrow entrance to Tory Channel in Cook Strait, utilising small high speed whale chasing boats. 

This extensively illustrated book is an outstanding chronicle of a unique industry. The Peranos' kind of whaling involved small, high-speed chasers which sometimes actually mustered humpback whales like a shepherd's dog rounds up sheep, driving them into the narrow entrance of Tory Channel for killing and processing at their shore factory

. In compiling this book Christchurch journalist Don Grady interviewed more than 80 former whalers employed by the Peranos and examined thousands of old diaries, records and photographs. 

Grady's extensively illustrated book is an outstanding chronicle of a colourful era in New Zealand's history, an immensely readable ""inside story"" of a unique industry and a unique way of life.

This book presents Vietnam War veterans as ordinary New Zealanders who did extraordinary things at that time of their lives when they went to serve in an unpopular war. 

The book demonstrates what they were able to achieve in their lives despite the fact that many of their compatriots despised them for going to Vietnam. 

The veterans include captains of New Zealand industry, highly ranked military and air force professionals, a Member of Parliament, a Harkness Fellow and Harvard Graduate, chief executive officers of commercial enterprises and welfare agencies, an expert horticulturalist, a polytechnic lecturer, a respected Maori elder, an All Black and a superintendent of a teaching hospital. New Zealand's trampers, potters, writers, gardeners, welfare workers, sports coaches, housewives, real estate agents, mechanics, rugby players and musicians are all represented. 

This book represents not only the estimated 3,500 who served in Vietnam but also the 37 who died in their country's service.

This edition 1988 Reed Edition

Ssoftcover; 160 pages w/ b/w photos, map & index. 25cmx18.5cm. 

Around the north-east of the Kaippara harbour author Dick Scott encountered the remarkable histories of seven families who had been in close contact with the Ngati Whatua during the early days of European settlement. 

In Seven Lives On Salt River he seeks out to find out who these people were, what beliefs they brought with them from Europe and how they adapted to a new land. 

Each family, in some way, left it's mark, like the Blackwells who were largely responsible for the botanical classic, Laing and Blackwells Plants of New Zealand. W Heathcote Jackman, the first successful grower of classic grapes - a success that owed something to his use of ground Maori bones for fertiliser.... 

Winner of the 1988 NZ Book Award 

But beyond the achievements and legacies of the families, it is the details of how they interacted with their new land and its Maori inhabitants that gives this book its fascination. It features more than 100 previously unpublished photos.

""She's a beauty!"" declared Ben Chifley, Prime Minister of Australia, after he unveiled the first all-Australian car in 1948. This book is a loving history of the first model Holden, the 48-215, known popularly as the FX, and its famous successor, the FJ. These two models have become among the most loved Holdens ever made. Don Loffler has spent sixteen years researching She's a Beauty!, corresponding with people all over Australia, as well as in the United States, England and Germany. The book includes stories never told before, photographs never published, and a wealth of technical information. The exciting period between 1945 and 1948, from the building of the first experimental cars to the launch of the Holden, is fully described. Entertaining memories of GMH employees and remarkable survival stories of the earliest Holdens illuminate the book. Older readers will enjoy the nostalgia as they read She's a Beauty! Younger ones will learn how momentous in the life of Australia the production of the first two Holden models really was.

The origins of New Zealand's cuisine can be traced back to our nineteenth-century immigrant ancestors. They were confronted with not only reversed seasons but plentiful fertile land and a generally warmer climate. This abundance combined with the strong traditions of the immigrants produced a cuisine based on a wide choice of meats, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, and characterised by plenty and hospitality.

Drawing on wealth of published and unpublished material, Tony Simpson examines in detail the development of our cuisine and domestic culture over the past two centuries.

Illustrated throughout with historical images and accompanied by recipes, A Distant Feast provides a fascinating overview of the place of food in the lives of New Zealanders.

In the 1950s a daredevil band of ex-World War II pilots established an entirely new industry in New Zealand - aerial topdressing. They flew underpowered, overloaded, de Havilland Tiger Moths, pouring superphosphate fertiliser onto steep hill country farms. 

It was the most demanding and dangerous peacetime flying job in the world. They were proud to be called the 'super men.'When Douglas Macgillgray joined the RNZAF in 1952, all he wanted to do was learn how to fly fighters - and the air force was happy to teach him. 

But he didn't anticipate the other lessons in life, love and death he would learn along the way.Above all, he didn't bargain for the explosion of emotions and events the beautiful, headstrong, radical student Bernadette would provoke. 

Nor how she would cause him to be plunged into the exhilarating, exhausting and sometimes fatal, world of the 'super men' . . .

What kinds of questions about inclusion, social justice and equity might it be pertinent and productive to ask of contemporary Aotearoa New Zealand early childhood teachers and their practice? 

When, how and why might teachers intervene to address issues of injustice and exclusion that arise in the context of early childhood work? 

These are the kinds of questions explored in this book. Addressing how teachers and policy makers can work for inclusion with diverse children and families, this book focuses on the development of positive attitudes to difference, diversity and inclusion. It suggests possible ways to reduce and eliminate barriers to learning and participation in early childhood communities. 

The authors interrogate notions of difference, inclusion and exclusion from the perspectives of Maori and cultural responsiveness, Te Tiriti o Waitangi and biculturalism, interculturalism, gender, sexualities, economic disadvantage, age, religion and disability.

This Book is an illustrated survey of the directions taken by twelve of New Zealand’s thousands of potters. 



The texts in this book are edited from tapes made by the potters, and their own words have been retained. Each potter has made a choice of pieces for illustration, not all of which are their most recent work. The style of each craftsman has resulted from an inheritance which is traced briefly in an introductory text indicating the struggles some of the longer-established potters had in their early pioneering days. The new generation of course is fortunate in that it can draw on experience, knowledge and published material from all over the world.

In burying their dead in Wanganui, the early settlers of this beautiful town left a unique historic and cultural record. Time and progress have not destroyed all the elements of the Wanganui General Cemetery, now most often referred to as the Heads Rd Cemetery. This little spot has become our very own outdoor museum, giving us a glimpse into the world of predominantly Victorian and Edwardian beliefs and burial and mourning customs. It was an era of elegance and craftsmanship that today seems overstated, yet touching and dignified.

We can still delight in the beautiful funeral sculpture from these eras, not the least being our beautiful angels whose presence inspired this book. Behind each angel is a story - maybe of your family.

Truly, there are ""Angels Among Us"" - if one knows where to find them.

 But this is not a ‘facts and figures’ history. Bob Gurr has been able to craft an excellent book, well supported by his personal photographs, of just what occurred during his period in command of this Battalion. And I guess what makes his efforts more readable are the anecdotes and humour that he has weaved into the story. 

Sure there are paragraphs on the organisation of a battalion, but for the non-military reader, having this limited knowledge will allow the reader to better understand how Gurr moved his Battalion around from post to post or area to area. 

Voices From a Border War also ably describes the reason why the ‘Gurr Battalion’ armed themselves to counter a border incursion into Malaysia by the Indonesian Army. 

Later on in the book, he exposes the operations that his Battalion undertook, this time out of Sarawak, and the ‘Claret Operations’ that occurred across the border against Indonesian military targets.

When John Logan Campbell landed on the shores of Coromandel Harbour in 1840, he had reached the kingdom of 'King' Wepiha, the American pork and timber trader. King Wepiha fired the young Scottish doctor with enthusiasm for the breathtaking Waitemata Harbour as the future capital of New Zealand.

The adventures of the carefree young Campbell in search of his fortune are both thrilling and amusing. The romantic interlude camping in a Maori village; the drama and savagery of a chief's tangi; the mysterious tragedies of the law of tapu; the extravagant feasts; the wisdom of the highly intelligent old chief Kanini; all these make Poenamo one of the most stirring tales of the birth of a city ever to be told.",FALSE,,TRUE,20.00,20.00,28.00,FALSE,FALSE,28.00,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;13.50=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;2.00=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;0.00=Pick up No Cost Or Combined Shipping;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2024-12-15 07.57.27.jpg;2024-12-14 07.11.45.jpg;2024-12-14 07.12.02.jpg;2024-12-15 07.57.32.jpg;2024-12-15 07.57.39.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"Week 8",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

On display there were boards of old & new photographs giving the feel of the extensive time period Anderson Memorials has witnessed & how changes have reflected over the years. Old scrapbooks with newspaper articles, accounts, wages books, death notices etc were there to view showing history in the making.
Also in the display area were modern granite headstones alongside the old marble type stones & old tools & saw blades of the trade etc.

She was registered in Sydney as a British ship on the 30th November 1841. She was basically a decked-over whaler’s longboat, and she was purchased by Taylor & Watt who filled her with merchandise; and they spent all their money down to their last half-crown, so it is said. The two of them set sail out of Sydney for New Zealand; now, they weren’t sailing into the great unknown because both men had served as mates and skippers of boats from Sydney and Melbourne to New Zealand, prior to 1841. So they knew where they were going, but they had the pluck to choose a little cutter with one sail, or with one mast. We know that the ‘Kitty J’ called at Auckland; she came down to Wellington. She took a load of bricks to Porirua, and then our records show that she turned up in the Whanganui River on the 10th April 1842 from Wellington, complete with sugar, tea, flour, beef, and three passengers. There was a Mrs Jackson, a Mr Lett, and a Mr Wansey, so there was the three passengers plus the two crew on that little boat. She was piloted up the river by the local Chief Constable, who happened to be down at the river mouth shooting ducks
The ‘Catherine Johnston’ commenced a regular trade to Wellington and Nelson; of course both Nelson and Wanganui were settlements by the New Zealand Company, and she became very, very busy.

Flags flying, bands playing, wonderful camaraderie and the anticipation of great adventure in places most would only have read or dreamt about were the anticipated attractions for many young men at the outset of the world wars, but the long grim reality was ugly, brutal and obscene. “Anyone who has ever looked into the glazed eyes of a soldier dying on the battlefield will think hard before starting a war.”


This book is about first-aid trained stretcher bearers, the unsung heroes attached to the field ambulances who went into the action carrying only a stretcher, a bag of field dressings, scissors and simple
medicines, and who saw equally to the needs of both friend and foe.
With text, photographs, cartoons, diagrams and copies of telegrams, letters and documents, this book is a remarkable account of the horrors of war, while inspiring respect and admiration for the bearers who were at even greater risk of becoming casualties themselves.

The illustrations are outstanding and an initial review of these encouraged a detailed read of the well written text with its information about the weapons and wounds of the Great War and World War II, frontline conditions, individual campaigns and battles, and diaries and letters home revealing the soldiers’ disillusionment with wars and
their organisation.

Khaki Angels will enlighten a wide range of readers, and for war historians

The Hori articles which fill it first appeared in N.Z. Home Line and Home Companion and are published here in book form in response to pleadings of readers of those journals in many parts of the country.

If you know your Hori you will be in step with the title; if you don't you won't read far before stumbling over his first half-Gallon jar.

Hori's world is not big, but it's full of fun. In addition to Hori himself, its principal characters are his wife, his mother in law, his brother in law and “the pakeha joker from up the street,” though other lesser characters make their brief appearances.

If at times Hori appears unreasonably hard on such people as car salesmen, traffic cops and politicians, he's only having his bit of fun. He's a well-fed, happily married, easy going Maori who gets on well with everyone and asks only to be allowed to tinker with his old V8, to sit and meditate while watching the oxalis grow, to eat his favorite crayfish claws, pigs' trotters and mussels and to drain his half gallon jar at the weekends.

A fair question would be whether Hori is really a Maori. He is not. In real life he is W. Norman McCallum of Waiatarua Road, Remuera, Auckland, a New Zealander of Scottish Descent. As a commercial traveler in the North Auckland and Waikato districts for many years he made countless firm friends among the Maori people, and his admiration of “the first New Zealanders” is unbounded.

Most New Zealand booklovers have heard of at least two of Lady Barker’s charming books on early colonial life — “Station Life in New Zealand” (first published in 1870) and “Station Amusements in New Zealand” (1873) — but how many have actually read them?
Rare today, they are not readily available outside libraries but, by the publication of the present facsimile editions, Wilson & Horton Ltd have brought them within reach of all who can appreciate New Zealand classics and wish to know more of this country’s beginnings.

In 1865, the author and her second husband, Frederick Broome, reached Christchurch on their way to take up a sheep run, 45 miles away in the foothills of the Southern Alps. The story of three happy years of life together there is told in a series of letters.
At Broomielaw, as they called their station, Lady Barker faced the unfamiliar round of domestic chores with the same cheerful acceptance as she crossed a mountain range in a heavy hailstorm, faced alone a charging (and very angry) boar, forced her horse to swim a flooded river or, as one of only five feminine partners available, danced until 4 a.m. at a country ball.
The author’s style has a charm and freshness vhich the passage of a century has dimmed not a whit. With an eye for essential detail and the sure instinct of an artist, she does not waste a single word.
Formerly Mary Anne Stewart, Lady Barker was born in Jamaica in 1831 and, in 1852, married Captain (later Sir) George Barker, who died in 1861. Four years afterwards she married Frederick Napier Broome, who, as Sir Frederick Broome, was Governor of Trinidad when he died in 1896. Previously he had been Lieutenant-Governor of Mauritius and Governor of Western Australia. Lady Broome (or Lady Barker, as she was known in New Zealand) died in 1911.

A remarkable enterprise, this book is a fine tribute both to the generations of men and women who have given long and loyal service tothe newman family of nelson and to the founding brothers and the succeeding generations of Newmans who have carried the firm forward into its second century

 In 1879 the Newman brothers began a stage coach service linking Nelson, where they lived, with the township of Murchison, 60 kms away. 

They had to cope with typical South Island rugged terrain, a rough track and all the problems that climate could conjure up. However, they persisted and 100 years later they were operating extensive bus services throughout the upper half of the South Island and over most of the North Island. While this is the story of a company, its founders and their successors, historically it is typical of the many problems and challenges that faced NZ land passenger operators from stage coach to motor coach --- the Newmans were NZ pioneers for both.

When John Logan Campbell landed on the shores of Coromandel Harbour in 1840, he had reached the kingdom of 'King' Wepiha, the American pork and timber trader. King Wepiha fired the young Scottish doctor with enthusiasm for the breathtaking Waitemata Harbour as the future capital of New Zealand.

The adventures of the carefree young Campbell in search of his fortune are both thrilling and amusing. The romantic interlude camping in a Maori village; the drama and savagery of a chief's tangi; the mysterious tragedies of the law of tapu; the extravagant feasts; the wisdom of the highly intelligent old chief Kanini; all these make Poenamo one of the most stirring tales of the birth of a city ever to be told.",FALSE,,TRUE,20.00,20.00,28.00,FALSE,FALSE,28.00,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;13.50=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;2.00=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;0.00=Pick up No Cost Or Combined Shipping;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2024-12-15 07.57.27.jpg;2024-12-14 07.11.45.jpg;2024-12-14 07.12.02.jpg;2024-12-15 07.57.32.jpg;2024-12-15 07.57.39.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"Week 3",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

At the core of The Birth of British Radar are Skip's memoirs of his involvement in the British radar from its very inception in 1935. Working under the direction of Robert Watson-Watt, it was he who proposed using radio waves, bounced back from an enemy aircraft, to detect its position. Initially working entirely alone, he constructed prototype equipment which he used in the famous Daventry experiment conducted in a field near Weeden, Northants, on 26 February 1935. The success of this led to the establishment of the R&D group at Bawdsey Manor with its team of talented scientists, engineers and technicians. From there he describes the engineering and political developments which occurred to change faint traces into a fully working system which played such a crucial role in defending Britain in the Second World War.

This second edition of The Birth of British Radar has been greatly expanded from the original memoirs with a large array of additional material. Each chapter of the memoirs is set in a historical context with an explanatory note. There is a host of extra material including an interview with Skip, details of how radar grew, post war commemorations and much more. .

Hunting A New Zealand history describes how hunting was essential to the successful colonization of this country. It has helped to build communities and families, and hunting knowledge has been handed down from generation to generation.

This rich and vivid, highly illustrated social history gives an insight into the world of the New Zealand hunter. Hunting is central to many New Zealanders' lives - whether it's to feed their families, earn a living or to explore the country's amazing wilderness.

Cutting across racial and class differences, hunting is intrinsic to the way New Zealanders view the natural world and the way we've experienced, closely observed and understood the bush. 

Hunting ties New Zealand to the world, yet the particular shape of hunting here makes it remarkably distinctive. If there is a 'national culture' in New Zealand, then hunting and hunters are at its core.

In 1865, the author and her second husband, Frederick Broome, reached Christchurch on their way to take up a sheep run, 45 miles away in the foothills of the Southern Alps. The story of three happy years of life together there is told in a series of letters.
At Broomielaw, as they called their station, Lady Barker faced the unfamiliar round of domestic chores with the same cheerful acceptance as she crossed a mountain range in a heavy hailstorm, faced alone a charging (and very angry) boar, forced her horse to swim a flooded river or, as one of only five feminine partners available, danced until 4 a.m. at a country ball.

Formerly Mary Anne Stewart, Lady Barker was born in Jamaica in 1831 and, in 1852, married Captain (later Sir) George Barker, who died in 1861. Four years afterwards she married Frederick Napier Broome, who, as Sir Frederick Broome, was Governor of Trinidad when he died in 1896. Previously he had been Lieutenant-Governor of Mauritius and Governor of Western Australia. Lady Broome (or Lady Barker, as she was known in New Zealand) died in 1911.

Stepping Back is a book for people who love exploring. It is a guide to the gems of South Island history, designed to help us fossick in our past without getting overwhelmed by it. It's not about museum history, but what's out there in the streets, paddocks and back- country of New Zealand.

 Behind every site there is a good story, and Mark Pickering has dug deep to uncover the human face of much of the South island's past. His explorations range from the hop kilns of Nelson to a Maori argillite factory high on a misty spur. 

There is the starlight-and-storms tale of a weather-beaten musterers' hut, a cemetery half-full of children's graves, and a gold-miners' water-race with a story as serpentine as the race itself. 
There is humour in the yarn of a canny whale-catcher, and tragedy on a lonely and lovely beach where the first European murder took place 

As in his other books, Mark Pickering shows a keen eye for the landscape, and he melds the hurley-burley of history with descriptions of the enduring landforms of the South Island in a colourful, and eminently readable text. 

The book details over 50 interesting walks (and sometimes drives) throughout the South Island. It advises on the practicalities of each expedition, with maps of every walk, and is fully illustrated with historical and modern photographs.

By Anne Salmond

In this rich and stylish description by New Zealand scholar Salmond, Cook's voyages take on a peculiar, dreamlike quality. 

Salmond's claim is that Cook was far more affected by his exposure to the Polynesian world than historians have thought. 

This book is fascinating as an incomparable travelogue filled with amazing stories - the sexual paradise of Tahiti, the 'discovery' of Hawaii, close relations with Maori, and Cook's tragic death on the beach in Hawaii.The 'trial' of the title followed a horrific incident in New Zealand's Queen Charlotte Sound when Maori killed and ate a boatload of Cook's men.

 Later, sailors caught a dog guzzling a pink remnant, put the dog on trial, then convicted, cooked and ate it.

Harvey was called up for war service in 1943.

After thorough interviewing and testing, she was chosen to work as a ""Wren"" in the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), allocated to ""Special Duties X"" at Bletchley Park. Here from early 1944, she worked in the ""Newmanry"" (named after Max Newman) using the Colossus computers for deciphering German High Command messages.

 Later she was responsible for the teleprinter room in the Newmanry, where Tunny (Lorenz cipher) messages were received from the main intercept station located in Kent.

Eleanor Southey Baker was born at French Farm, Akaroa, New Zealand, on 13 September 1879


Eleanor's parents decided that she should train as a doctor, and despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for a medical career she graduated from the University of Otago Medical School in 1903. She then gained her licentiate in midwifery at the Coombe Lying-in Hospital, Dublin, returning to New Zealand in 1904.

 From then until 1914 Eleanor Baker took a variety of temporary appointments: at Seacliff and Ashburn Hall mental hospitals; the Northern Wairoa Hospital at Te Kōpuru, Northland; and locum positions with other doctors in various parts of the country. Her attempts to set up in general practice were thwarted by lack of finance and by prejudice against women practitioners. She was not, one little boy informed her, a 'proper ""dokker"" '. More isolated areas could not afford to be so choosy about their medical care, and Baker eventually returned to Te Kōpuru, this time in general practice.

The lighter side of the Vietnam war as told by New Zealand Officer Billy Barnz. 

This is an account of life in small town New Zealand and in the Army of the 1960s for one member of the Baby-Boomer generation.

 It tells of a strange lad who defied conventional economic wisdom by enlisting in the Services in a time of full-employment 
The story begins with a Mission-from-God scenario in the New Zealand bush in the early 1960s. Convent School graduate Billy receives a vocation to hunt down and eliminate the forces of evil in the world that he sees embodied in the international terrorist/freedom fighter Ho Chi Minh - herein irreverently referred to as The Old Goat because of his good looks. 

The mission leads Billy through an unlikely and ineffective militarist education to the field of battle in the most unpopular war of the twentieth century. There he fights alongside a band of equally crazy brothers, but thankfully under the command of a very wise leader, pouring death and destruction on the unsuspecting trees of the Vietnamese rain forest. Scarred and changed by his experience, he returns home to an even stranger world dominated by civilian values that challenge him to the very core of his moral molecular structure. He teeters on the brink of normality. The Goat Hunter reveals devastating scandals of antipodean military life in the hippy age. There are reports of April-foolery in the Fire Support Base; maniacal mayhem in the massage parlour; endless bouts of Army alcoholic athletics; and the total failure of the Defence Clothing Committee to outfit its soldiers for war properly at a time when elasticized boxer shorts were essential for jungle survival.

The Aorangi ski club began as a group of people drawn together by a love of skiing. Each year the group made trips to the Hermitage and, one evening, in the Hermitage bar, decided to tackle skiing closer to home. It was decided to form a permanent club and thus Aorangi was born. In the early years the Aorangi members still made their annual pilgrimage to Mt Cook and the South to ski and find new fields. They kept active in the summer months with trips around the Wellington region.
By 1934 the membership was 86 and members were skiing at Mt Ruapehu, Mt Cook, Mt Taranaki and the Ruahines

After the battle of Orakau in 1864 and the end of the war in the Waikato, Tawhiao, the second Maori King, and his supporters were forced into an armed isolation in the Rohe Potae, the King Country. 

For the next twenty years, the King Country operated as an independent state - a land governed by the Maori King where settlers and the Crown entered at risk of their lives.

Dancing with the King is the story of the King Country when it was the King's country, and of the negotiations between the King and the Queen that finally opened the area to European settlement. For twenty years, the King and the Queen's representatives engaged in a dance of diplomacy involving gamesmanship, conspiracy, pageantry and hard headed politics, with the occasional act of violence or threat of it. 

While the Crown refused to acknowledge the King's legitimacy, the colonial government and the settlers were forced to treat Tawhiao as a King, to negotiate with him as the ruler and representative of a sovereign state, and to accord him the respect and formality that this involved. Colonial negotiators even made Tawhiao offers of settlement that came very close to recognising his sovereign authority.Dancing with the King is a riveting account of a key moment in New Zealand history as an extraordinary cast of characters - Tawhiao and Rewi Maniapoto, Donald McLean and George Grey - negotiated the role of the King and the Queen, of Maori and Pakeha, in New Zealand.

Hardback VG condition He arrived in December 1858 as geologist on the Austrian Novara Expedition, at a time when much of the British colony was little known to science. Hochstetter was soon asked to investigate the vast hinterland of Auckland province and, after that, Nelson’s too.

            In early 1859, Hochstetter, with his countryman Julius Haast, travelled by foot, horseback and canoe deep into the North Island’s interior to the volcanic zone. Hochstetter recorded a dramatic account of all he saw, including the remarkable Pink and White Terraces. He also vividly documented his encounters with many Maori along the way, from high chief to mailman. Whether describing his mediating between warring clans or arguments over Sunday observance and wedding feast protocols, he delivered an engaging account of Maori life in the Waikato in the last years of peace.
 Hochstetter also documented the country’s unusual flora and fauna. Some of the many new species he collected were named after him, including a giant land snail and a primitive frog. In Nelson he obtained the first complete skeletons of the giant extinct moa, as well as a rock new to science from Dun Mountain, which he named dunite. His collaboration with Haast proved even more fruitful, and on Hochstetter’s endorsement his friend was appointed leader of an arduous expedition to the West Coast in 1860",FALSE,,TRUE,42.00,42.00,48.00,FALSE,FALSE,62.00,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;14.00=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;2.00=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;0.00=Pick up No Cost Or Combined Shipping;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2025-01-04 13.55.06.jpg;2025-01-04 13.55.15.jpg;2025-01-04 13.55.26.jpg;2025-01-04 13.55.42.jpg;2025-01-04 13.56.18.jpg;2025-01-04 13.56.32.jpg;2025-01-04 13.56.45.jpg;2025-01-04 13.56.59.jpg;2025-01-04 13.57.05.jpg;2025-01-04 13.57.22.jpg;2025-01-04 13.57.37.jpg;2025-01-04 13.57.50.jpg;2025-01-04 13.58.05.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"HIGHEST STOCK",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

Old New Zealand Houses 1800 - 1940 by Jeremy Salmond

They appear everywhere in the New Zealand landscape, a wonderfully distinctive collection of older houses in all shapes and sizes, ranked along city or small-town streets or dotted across farming hillsides and by country roads.

This book is both a history and a celebration of New Zealand's magnificent old houses, a clear and approachable account of how these houses were made and inhabited.

Above all it is an account of the methods used in their construction - from traditional Maori dwellings and the earliest European houses of cob and adobe, to the rise of the 'kitset' villa building industry in the later half of the nineteenth century.

 It chronicles the impact of the Californian and Spanish bungalows, the 'arts and crafts' cottages, and the quirky Modernes built in New Zealand before World War II. Significantly, this account ends with the introduction of the state house.

Jeremy Salmond's book is sumptuously illustrated with old and new photographs and exact technical drawings.

 Extracts from contemporary letters, diaries and trade literature evoke the qualities admired in each major house style.

Its call sign was Fernleaf Cairo, and between 1939 and 1946, around 76,000 Kiwis of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force passed through Maadi Camp. 

Around 17 kilometres south of Cairo, the camp appeared almost overnight, as this country's permanent overseas base during the Second World War. By 1945 the camp had tar-sealed roads, two cinemas, an open-air amphitheatre, canteens, bars, chapels, sports fields, a meat-pie and ice-cream factory, and - thanks to General Bernard Freyberg - swimming baths. 

Egypt was a source of boundless amazement, sly humour and some disgust to the New Zealanders, an experience which left its mark, both on our language - taking a shufti - and more tangibly, the Maadi Rowing Cup. 

With unpublished images and first-hand accounts, Fernleaf Cairo offers a fascinating insight into the unlikely bond young New Zealanders forged with the people and city of Cairo, including their many highly colourful experiences on leave.

A pictorial smorgasbord of 176 photographs of Wellington streets as they grew and developed through the 20th century. A book of discovery for those who did not live in the days when trams ruled the streets of Wellington and, for others, a wonderful look back in time to those days, with many memories of the city and suburbs and the personalities of the different decades.

 Graham Stewart has brought together a unique collection of photographs, over 80 taken by himself in the early 1950s and never published before, of Wellington before the arrival of the modern city we know today. This is a timely book which records the century and shows graphically how Wellington has grown since 1900. It is full of nostalgia, showing the pioneer buildings, the street furniture of the past, the shops, the fashions. It is a fascinating ride back in time which will interest Wellingtonian's and everyone who has a special affection for this gem of a hilly city with so much to offer its citizens and visitors

This book will strike a loud chord with anyone who has ever tried to get their business to run before it can walk and never taken no for an answer. It captures the chaos and excitement of building the McDonald’s brand in a New Zealand more used to grotty hand basins and scraps of toilet paper on the floor than the American world of McPerfection.

Author Rosemary Hepözden paints an endearing, and at times quite bonkers, picture of the McDonald’s early days in New Zealand. Of managers sleeping on shelves on the premises, too tired to go home in the few hours between shifts. Of thousands of coupon-waving customers waiting for their Big Macs. And of early founder Wally Morris cementing a kitchen unit to the floor, despite import restrictions so tight that he was meant to re-export the unit after a year in the country!

It tells the roller-coaster ride of a bunch of savvy Kiwis thrust into a slice of American culture so precise that the manual said the toilet had to be cleaned with a toothbrush, and hamburgers must be adorned with no less than 16, and no more than 18, tiny pieces of onion.

Often unable to lay their hands on the right stuff at the right time, these early McPioneers trained staff with wooden patties and cardboard French fries, and tried to get Kiwi suppliers to switch from ‘she’ll be right’ to ‘just so’.

Wearing the colour red, living by the 'law of lawnessness' and having the patch with the emblem of the mighty bulldog on your back was what ex-Mongrel Mob leader Tuhoe 'Bruno' Isaac called being True Red. ""Because all levels of society hated us we created a new society of hatred symbolised by the bulldog. Its ferocious habits were engraved on our hearts,"" Tuhoe says, ""If you weren't a mobster you weren't worth knowing."" He lived this way for 17 years.

However, constantly living for the bash, beer, prison and the possibility of dying in a pool of blood eventually saw Tuhoe search for another way of doing life. Leaving the Mob was hard. Not only did he face the rejection of his own and the fierce judgemental prejudices of mainstream society, but with the awakening of his conscience came the realisation of a past filled with inflicting pain on others besides himself, and of a life devoid of any sense of love or hope. This led him down a path of confession, forgiveness and reconciliation.

Looking Back is the second in an exciting series of books that celebrates New Zealand's incredible motorsport legacy.


For the first time in book form New Zealand's foremost motorsport photographer, Terry Marshall, has collected together over 250 superb motor racing images from his historic archives.

 This highly collectible volume of motorsport images will transport readers back to a golden age of New Zealand motorsport where they can witness, once again, the power of bellowing V8 saloons and the thunderous blitzkrieg of Formula 5000 single-seaters . . . Strap-in for an action-packed ride through New Zealand's motorsport heritage . .

Looking Back captures the drivers and the cars through the camera of renowned motorsport photographer Terry Marshall, who was on hand to capture all the tyre-burning action in an era when local racing heroes thrilled spectators throughout New Zealand.

From the early days of the first Tasman Cup Series - which saw New Zealand drivers locking horns with international drivers such as Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart, Jochen Rindt and Piers Courage - the wonderful images in Looking Back move onwards through thunderous F5000s and mighty 'big-banger' saloons, and conclude with a Formula Pacific photo-essay.

Adding further interest to Terry's wonderful photography, a whole host of local and overseas drivers add their personal comments to the photographs - always informative, sometimes critical, and at times, controversial, the drivers' own words allow instant access to New Zealand's motor racing scene during the '60s and. '70s.

The first wave started in 1939 with tea rooms and milk bars revolutionising to introduce freshly roasted coffee as the central offering.

This is the story of Bill Hamilton

As well as giving his name to the company he founded in 1939, C.W.F.(Bill) Hamilton left a legacy of combining sound engineering practices with innovation and excellence. As a small boy he had dreamed of a boat that would carry him up the swift flowing rivers of his homeland. Such foresight was typical of this distinguished New Zealand inventor and innovator.

In 1954 his dream became a reality, and in the 50 years since the Hamilton Waterjet has revolutionised the world of conventional boating.

A humble man, Sir William often claimed that it was not he who invented the waterjet - that honour he attributed to the great mind of Archimedes. His greatest achievement was to improve the idea and make it work in the specialised field of boat propulsion.

He repeatedly stressed the psychological nature of chess, for example.

By Keith and Nona Morris

This is an unusual book in that it records the memories of two people in seperate chapters as such. The first part of the book is the memoirs of RNZAF pilot Keith Morris, who gives an account of his training in New Zealand and Canada. He went on to fly in Europe but did not cover that part of his career.

The book then switches to the memories of his wife, Nona Morris, who joined the WAAF and had a full career on several bases, including Wigram, Cashmere, Norwood and Bell Block. She describes the war years on RNZAF Stations with great clarity and this is a superb look at life in New Zealand's Air Force at home.

There are also many photos throughout the book.

For anyone who is interested in the Home Front in New Zealand and especially the training command of the RNZAF, this is an excellent book. It is also a wonderful slice of social history.

Here are authentic first-person accounts from the graffiti writers and artists whose creative genius fuelled the earliest flowering of the movement in late 1970s and early 1980s New York. Henry Chalfant’s photographs in Subway Art inspired budding graffiti writers around the world; now read the stories behind those iconic images in the words of the pioneers of the graffiti movement.          


In the late 1970s, New York City was bankrupt, dirty and dangerous. Born on these grimy streets, graffiti rapidly made its mark. Here, twelve legendary graffiti writers – Bil Rock, Breezer, Daze, Jon One, Kel, KR, Lady Pink, Sak, Sharp, Skeme, Spin and Team – give first-person accounts of their experiences. Individually interviewed for this book by Sacha Jenkins, they reveal an authentic, unparalleled insight into the golden age of graffiti.

By Joan Druett

'Bully' Hayes. A rogue, yes, a scoundrel and, according to numerous, conflicting reports, a criminal. Joan Druett has sifted through the evidence, newspaper stories, eye witness accounts, ships' logs and records and documents of all sorts, to separate fact from fabulous.
She has left us with a portrait of an irritating, dishonest, giant of a man with poor morals and a habit of turning up in the wrong place at the wrong time.

That he owed a lot of people a lot of money is not disputed, and that he had his wicked way with women over too broad an age range is on record, but a pirate? Perhaps we are conditioned to the Errol Flynn/Johnny Depp characterisation and Hayes does not quite fit that description.

Regardless, Joan Druett has done an impressive job and presented us with the facts and the opinion of a lot of his contemporaries, many of whom were left much the poorer by his antics and activities.
Whatever you think of him, William Hayes was a character and his story needed to be told.

Hayes was a notable early figure in the history of the Otago region of New Zealand. After facing bankruptcy in Australia in the late 1850s, he sailed to Otago in 1862 He travelled the region with a travelling company of vaudeville artists on a tour of New Zealand. In January 1863 they arrived at Arrowtown. Hayes married a widow Mrs Roma 'Rosie' Buckingham, whose four sons were vaudeville artists, performing as The Masters Buckingham. Hayes and Roma settled in Arrowtown where he opened a hotel, the ""United States""

Book Mainly deals with his time on the sea

Methodist women were among the earliest settlers in New Zealand. Many Maori women have joined them in aroha, finding an expression of their spirituality through the Christian faith. Out of the Silence tells of the contribution of Methodist women to Church and society over a century and a half. It contains stories of pioneering courage, of women's resourcefulness, and their support for one another. At the same time, it reflects: changes in attitudes towards women and the movement towards a greater use of their talents in the wider ministry of the Church.

Ruth Fry has written articles on the history of Women's education and her book, It's Different for Daughters, appeared in 1985. As an Anglican, with wide experience in teaching and voluntary work, she brings fresh insights to the neglected history of women's participation in the Church. This non- partisan account will appeal to a wide readership.

The Bone People explores the potential within families for both destruction and healing, as well as the great personal costs of the disintegration of individual connections to traditional communities and cultures - in this case, the indigenous Maori culture of New Zealand.

The novel centers on a strange trinity of characters, each isolated, each spiritually adrift. Simon, a mute child surrounded by mysteries, is found on a beach and is adopted by Joe, a Maori man embittered by the loss of his wife and son and thwarted in his desire for family, religious, and cultural ties. The two are bound together by ""a bloody kind of love that has violence as its silent partner."" Simon and Joe come into the life of Kerewin, a part-Maori woman estranged from her family. She is a strong woman, compassionate and powerful, a sensualist who delights in color and landscape, food and archaic language, but who is also wary and conflicted. The three come together, break apart, experience great pain and loss, and eventual healing.

Ultimately, the family they create stands as Keri Hulme's assertion of vitality and regeneration for individuals, families and traditional cultures.

The Christchurch Port Hills feature in the legendary travels of Tamatea and the more robust exploits of Te Rangiwhakaputa and Te Rauparaha. 

They were a welcome landfall to early explorers, sealers, whalers, traders, missionaries and surveyors, for whom these hills also provided shelter, fuel and handy lookout points.

Donald Cairncross Todd was born in Wellington and lived his formative years there before being sent to Nelson College for his secondary education. 

During his growing up in Eastbourne he and a friend built a small launch that they steamed across Cook Strait to the Marlborough Sounds. After serving an electrical apprenticeship and a time in the Chatham Islands he went back to the “Sounds” where he became involved in a guest house and launch charter work.

 Later an electrical contracting business was started and covered the top of the South Island. The sea was always his first love and after many years, and vessels, Don is now officially “retired” from both electrical and commercial boating.

 Now in his mid seventies, in his retirement, he still wires boats, houses and commercial buildings.

In the rest of the world they say that if you can remember the sixties you weren't really there - but what was it like in New Zealand? 

For us the decade began with conservative prosperity - the establishment knew best and most Kiwis knew their place. Doors were left unlocked in postwar 'golden weather' and the All Blacks ruled. Within five years Beatlemania, the pill and the youth revolution saw baby boomers become teenagers in a process of dramatic, head-spinning change. 

Fashion, hairstyles and music rocked society as lifestyles, gender roles and sexual options challenged the status quo. Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll flourished as the Vietnam War raged and the 'summer of love' flowed on - even the All Blacks began throwing the ball around. 

By the end of the sixties Neil Armstrong had walked on the moon, the Beatles were fragmenting and the All Blacks were growing long in the tooth. As the good times faded, Kiwis started locking their doors.

The city runs south from Bluff Hill, a small promontory jutting into Hawke Bay, along the coast and inland towards Hastings. The central business district (CBD) is close to the Marine Parade foreshore reserve and gardens. Rebuilt in an art deco style after the 1931 earthquake, the CBD is a bustling place, with many boutique fashion stores, galleries, restaurants and bars. Napier is separated from Hastings, its neighbour and rival, by orchards and vineyards, and by Napierites’ strongly held attitudes about their identity.

History Of its First contacts with Maori In 1769 Untill 1974

Founded in 1855 by the government, Napier (formerly known as Ahuriri) is Hawke’s Bay’s oldest town. Like Hastings and Havelock North, Napier is named after a prominent figure in British India. Its earliest streets commemorate military men, scientists and writers.


The new town was in an unprepossessing location – a small semi-island between the sea and an inner harbour, which was prone to flooding. Road access to the ‘mainland’ was limited. An early account described it as ‘a hopeless spot for a town site’.1 However, it was an ideal location for a port, which was why Napier became the leading town of the region and the centre of government, business, social and leisure activities.",FALSE,,TRUE,30.00,30.00,42.00,FALSE,FALSE,42.00,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;13.00=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;2.00=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;1.00=Combine with another item you've paid shipping on;0.00=Pick up No Cost Or Combined Shipping;11.00=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2025-01-20 15.55.10.jpg;2025-01-20 15.53.34.jpg;2025-01-20 15.53.54.jpg;2025-01-20 15.54.23.jpg;2025-01-20 15.54.31.jpg;2025-01-20 15.54.34.jpg;2025-01-20 15.54.42.jpg;2025-01-20 15.54.44.jpg;2025-01-20 15.55.03.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"week 23",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

This remarkable personal record by Alice McKenzie of her pioneering days in a remote south-west corner of New Zealand ... conveyed ... the reality of everyday life for many of the people who immigrated to New Zealand during the 19th century.

 Alice's story of her family and other settlers in and a round Martins Bay, some 30 kilometres north of Milford Sound, is one of endurance and independence in the face of hardship and isolation. This third edition  includes, for the first time, excerpts from Alice's personal diaries and papers commented on by her only granddaughter It heightens the romance, humour, pathos and tragedy evident in her narrative, and brings new understanding to the many remarkable incidents she describes, including her encounter in 1880 with what she believed may have been one of New Zealand's last bush moa

 More stories from Northwest Nelson By  Gerard Hindmarsh




Building on the success of Kahurangi Calling and Kahurangi Stories, Gerard Hindmarsh’s latest offering Kahurangi Out West is the final in this trilogy of stories from the backcountry of Northwest Nelson.
An area of outstanding ecological and geological complexity, Kahurangi also generated a rich and colourful social history. Told here are the stories which start with the earliest human arrivals and finish with the family stories of the graziers who live along Kahurangi’s wild western flank today.
Drovers, loggers, mill workers, top secret coast watchers, linesmen, miners and uranium prospectors, there’s also the story of King Tom of the Matakitaki, and one man’s obsession with traversing the formidable Dragon’s Teeth of the Douglas Range. Highly readable and engaging, Kahurangi Out West weaves together the best stories to make a compelling blend of tales about a remarkable corner of New Zealand. Written by a local with a love of the area and a nose for a good story.

Ahead was a social journey to Palmerston North accompanied by players from Canterbury and Lincoln Universities, followed by glorious days of tournament cricket. As the eleven players stepped on board none could foresee that by the end of the voyage fifty-one of their fellow passengers would be dead. Nor, that not a ball would be bowled in Palmerston North. The Team That Never Played is the story of those eleven Otago players, their frightening experience on TEV Wahine, and what became of their lives in the forty-five years since that fateful journey. After forty-five years the Wahine tragedy, according to a TVNZ viewers' poll, remains the fourth-largest television news story in New Zealand. Despite its wide coverage, there remain many inconsistencies and myths surrounding the ferry's sinking - and many stories to be told. This publication offers a unique perspective on the greatest shipping disaster of the twentieth century in New Zealand from the members of the Otago University cricket team. They, along with others involved in the rescue efforts or present in Wellington that day, have provided, in some cases, never-before-told accounts of the events of 10 April 1968.

Includes colour plates reproducing 49 of Sharpe's works, while a further five appear among the black and white illustrations.

This book examines the art of one of New Zealand's most distinguished watercolourists of the colonial period.  Alfred Sharpe (1836-1908) played a leading role in Auckland's art culture of the 1870s and 1880s, receiving support exclusively from private collectors.

  No example of his work was acquired for a public collection until well into the twentieth century, when details of his career had been forgotten
.  Sharpe was destined to become the enigma of NZ art history, reputedly a deaf mute, the details of which birth, life and death were unknown.

By patiently sifting through the evidence in old newspapers Roger Blackley has excavated an astonishing story of Sharpe's struggle for recognition as an artist.

 The Scandinavian Settlements in the Forty Mile Bush offers a fascinating glimpse into a unique chapter of New Zealand's colonial history. It delves into the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of the Scandinavian immigrants who carved out a life for themselves in the dense, challenging landscape of the Forty Mile Bush (now known as the Tararua and southern Ruahine Ranges) in the late 19th century.

Petersen's strength lies in his meticulous research and engaging storytelling. He doesn't just present a dry historical account; he weaves a narrative rich with personal anecdotes, letters, and reminiscences, bringing the reader intimately close to the lives of these hardy pioneers. We learn of their arduous journey to New Zealand, their initial struggles with the unfamiliar environment, the backbreaking work of clearing the dense forest, and their resourcefulness in building homes and establishing communities.

The book excels in depicting the daily realities of life in the bush. 

Beyond the personal stories, ""Forest Homes"" offers valuable insights into the broader context of New Zealand's colonial history. It sheds light on the government's immigration policies of the time, the social and economic conditions that prompted these Scandinavians to leave their homeland, and the impact of their arrival on the landscape and society of the region.

The pull of the bush proved to be stronger than his job as a builder so he eventually became a forestry contractor, which has allowd him to hunt every spare moment since the 1950's.

A Sowman family history

Frederick Sowman (1884–1971) married three times. His first marriage was in 1906 to Annie (Maud) Stapp, daughter of Alfred Gordon Stapp and Annie Maria (née White) of Nelson. His second marriage, after Maud’s death, was in 1943 to Hilda McConkey (previously Hilda Reay, née Haase). Hilda died in 1943 and is buried in the Waihopai Cemetery. There were no children from this marriage. His third marriage was in 1948 to Hazel Bartlett.

The book is co-authored by Robert Sowman and Havell Stephen-Smith, with Havell Stephen-Smith also acting as the editor. It was published in 2008.

The book briefly describes the economic conditions in England in the mid-1800s, and relationships between the colonisers Edward Gibbon and Arthur Wakefield and William Songer (founder of Stoke, Nelson), Rev. Charles Torlesse, and William and Sarah and other Nelson settlers. A detailed account of William and Sarah's voyage and subsequent experiences in Lyttelton, Christchurch and Nelson is a highlight of the book.

Blue-Eyed, Fair and Stocky includes a family tree meticulously compiled by Peter Sowman. It shows the birthdates, marriages and deaths of the eight generations of family members in New Zealand, beginning with William and Sarah.

• As a result of marriages, there are now some 3250 individuals listed and nearly 900 surnames indexed.

A separate chapter is included for each of William and Sarah's children and their families.

New Zealand's Fiordland, remote and romantic, is more than an area of rugged, primitive beauty. It is also of historic interest, for Captain Cook landed here, at Dusky Sound (1773) and from then on, its recorded history can be traced.

During the twentieth century Fiordland's extraordinary scenic attractions, its wapiti herd, and its vast hydro-electric power re-sources have lead to its survey and exploita-tion; but in the pre-European period, and during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was largely unsurveyed, uninhabited, unappreciated.

The Fiordland people of the period in-cluded the Maori the existence of the mysterious ""lost tribe"" is thoroughly dis-cussed European navigators, whalers and sealers, explorers and surveyors, goldfos-sickers and hermits, fishermen and farmers.

It is only with these earlier people that the book is concerned. The author, a direct descendant of one of the pioneer surveyors and a son of the noted Southland historian, has spent years of patient and meticulous research into his subject, he has produced a book that is not only the first comprehensive and definitive study of the pre-twentieth century period but has also made of it a most fascinatingly readable book.

During his research he has, too, compiled a notable collection of early maps and draw-ings, most of which are now reproduced for the first time giving an added value and distinction to the work.

In 1936 and 1937 the modern Royal Navy cruisers, Achilles and Leander were deployed to the RN's New Zealand division. These ships carried the prefix HMS before the name until late in 1941 when the independent Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was established. By this time both cruisers had been combat proven in many war zones and complements were largely made up of NZ personnel. One of these was the author who served aboard Leander as a radio operator. For Leander early duties were escorting small troop movements in the South Pacific and searching far to the south for possible German merchant ships. After further escort duty on large troop convoys Leander's war hotted up with action in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, then redeploying to the Pacific where war with Japan had began. Service in the Solomons area saw the Leander torpedoed in the night Battle of Kula Gulf (July 1943). A huge hole was blown in her portside amidships and engine power was lost. With part of her machinery restored the cruiser was able to limp slowly to Tulagi where temporary repains were made so that Leander could proceed to Auckland under her own steam for more extensive repairs. At the end of November 1943 the Leander was able to leave on a trans-Pacific voyage to Boston, via a the Panama Canal, for further repair work and modernisation

The book covers Rudel's life from his childhood to his military career, including his experiences as a Stuka pilot on the Eastern Front. It also discusses his post-war life and his involvement in neo-Nazi politics.

The book has been praised for its detailed account of Rudel's wartime experiences, but it has also been criticized for its sympathetic portrayal of Rudel and its lack of critical analysis of his actions and beliefs.

Some reviewers have noted that the book does not adequately address Rudel's role in the Nazi regime and his post-war involvement in neo-Nazi politics. However, most reviewers agree that it is a valuable and informative book that sheds light on the life and work of an important World War II figure.

A the age of 16, Dean Taylor was invited to go on his first hunting party to Stewart Island. It was a trip that immediately captivated him with the rugged beauty of the island, and the thrill of the hunt of deer in such a remote part of the world. 

Since then he's been back to the island another 21 times.

Over the years, Dean gets together a regular hunting party, a group of men who enjoy the chase, the scenery and more than a few beers. The tales are told with humour and capture the comraderie and the isolation that is experienced while hunting in such a remote part of the world. The lads have been chased by sharks, have had numerous close shaves with tree rats and have possibly shot as many deer as they have missed.

 The tally of deer carcasses is only surpassed by the tally of empty beer cans on their return to the mainland. Would you believe that on more than one hunting trip Dean has come across a hippo on Stewart Island?

Each journey is packed with tales of the particular challenges of the route, of chance encounters with locals, and arrangements, often makeshift, for eating and sleeping. Interwoven throughout are interesting, seemingly spontaneous digressions on local history and Maori mythology. 


Although it is 50 years since this compilation was first published, the details in each of the four major walks undertaken by A.H. Reed are as fresh and interesting today as they were when he took the first step of his journey in 1946 and subsequently wrote about that same year (Farthest East: Afoot in Maoriland Byways, followed by Farthest North: Afoot in Maoriland Byways also in 1946; then Farthest West: Afoot and Afloat in 1950; and Farthest South in 1953).

NZ Wild Life is an engrossing and illuminating exploration into the everyday biology of New Zealand.

An entirely new look at the shocking impact of the First World War on New Zealand.

For New Zealand, World War One was wholly avoidable, wholly unnecessary — and almost wholly disastrous. 

Stevan Eldred-Grigg believes that the enormous cost of the war to our people was way too high — and that we still feel its effects, both socially and culturally, today. 

This is excellent narrative non-fiction, analysing our history in a novel way. It's very accessible but is backed up by meticulous research.

 Stevan goes against the accepted line and gives us a fascinating look at our social history before, during and just after WW1. 

Why did we go to the war in Europe? Was the country united in its desire for war? What were the economic and social consequences? What has been the impact on the psyches of New Zaeland men? 

These and many other questions are answered

The collection includes his seminal essay, God, Man and Universe: A Māori View and an extract is also included from his final seminar delivered at Te Wānanga-o-Raukawa in Ōtaki.


 2003 Edition


Rev. Maori Marsden (1924-1993) was a tohunga, scholar, writer, healer, minister and philosopher of the latter part of the twentieth century. From the Tai Tokerau in the north, Maori was both an ordained Anglican minister and a graduate of the whare wānanga, the traditional tribal centre of higher and esoteric learning. He was uniquely placed to explore and explain the frontier between pre-Christian theology, understandings of divinity and the Māori worldview, and his Christian faith and vocation. His conclusions and perspectives on these matters are widely influential and speak meaningfully to his people whose spiritual welfare he was dedicated to.

Throughout his life, Maori was asked to speak and heal in Māori communities throughout the country and he wrote a substantial amount of material on matters facing the contemporary Māori quest for social justice and the achievement of authentic being.

In his writings, sensitively edited by Te Ahukaramū Charles Royal, Marsden's thoughts venture far and wide and include analyses and views on key concepts in the Māori worldview and knowledge, politics, science (particularly the New Physicists), the Treaty of Waitangi, the legal system and much more.

Tikanga Maori Living by Maori Values by Hirini Moko Mead Revised Edition

Tikanga Maori is the authoritative and accessible introduction to understanding the correct Maori ways of doing things as they were done in the past, as they are done in the present - and as they may yet be.

In this revised edition, Hirini Mead has added an extensive new chapter on mana whenua, mana moana, Maori authority over land and ocean, and the different interpretations and applications of mana whenua and mana moana historically and today.

Hirini Mead has also updated the section on tangihanga to include contemporary issues about cremation choices and what happens to the deceased in Maori/non-Maori partnerships where there are disputes about following tangi tikanga or Pakeha traditions.

The remainder of the book explores how tikanga Maori may influence contemporary life and society, and Hirini Mead proposes guidelines to help us test appropriate responses to challenges that may yet be laid down.

This remarkable personal record by Alice McKenzie of her pioneering days in a remote south-west corner of New Zealand ... conveyed ... the reality of everyday life for many of the people who immigrated to New Zealand during the 19th century.

 Alice's story of her family and other settlers in and a round Martins Bay, some 30 kilometres north of Milford Sound, is one of endurance and independence in the face of hardship and isolation. This third edition  includes, for the first time, excerpts from Alice's personal diaries and papers commented on by her only granddaughter It heightens the romance, humour, pathos and tragedy evident in her narrative, and brings new understanding to the many remarkable incidents she describes, including her encounter in 1880 with what she believed may have been one of New Zealand's last bush moa

No rich farmlands here for pioneers to cultivate. But men have come here for gold and sealskins to harvest succulent whitebait, to hunt wapiti and red deer, to re-discover birds long believed extinct, to revel in superb scenery, and, latterly to harness lakes and rivers for hydro-electric power.

Among these men have been many a rare character: Wildlife guardians, explorers, hermits, fishermen. And many notable events that have happened aling the lonely coasts and in its empty hinderland-shipwrecks, mysterious disappearances, settlements that failed and are forgotten; and queer stories, still persistent, of a ""lost tribe"" of Maoris, is still living furtively in the forests.

Of all these things Jack Mcclenaghan writes, and writes vividly. Journalist and novelist, he has for years spent all his leisure in deep Fiordland, hunting, fishing, and exploring. A true man of Southland, he has an unequalled knowledge of Fiordland's history, legend, and tradition, and he presents a complete conspectus of this fascinating, little-known, unspoiled, tract of New Zealand.

From a wealth of historic and scenic material he has selected a magnificient range of illustrations, a worthy supplement to a lively, accurate text.

During his research he has, too, compiled a notable collection of early maps and drawings, most of which are now reproduced for the first time giving an added value and distinction to the work.

Tucked away in the Māniototo region of Central Otago, Gilchrist and Sons General Store is a survivor. Operating under the same name and serving the same communities it did when business-savvy Thomas Gilchrist established it in 1902, the store is a living reminder of this once ubiquitous form of shopping in Aotearoa New Zealand. 

For decades, shops like Gilchrist’s sold everything from bread to bedding, cabbages to cigarettes, dusters to dynamite, fabrics to fencing, garters to gasoline, and much, much more, all crammed into one space. These stores cum community hubs were most evident in rural towns and villages. All gave their customers personalised service; most offered ‘store to door’ grocery and mail deliveries. 

The three generations of the Gilchrist family who owned the store and, for a time, an ancillary one at Ranfurly, excelled at both, and their customers knew it. Set against the backdrop of the social, economic, and political forces that helped shape the fortunes of Gilchrist and Sons’ Ōtūrēhua store, the story this book tells is as much about the communities that benefited from the shop as it is about the shop itself, the enterprising and loved family who ran it for so long and the people who have kept it open since.

When John Logan Campbell landed on the shores of Coromandel Harbour in 1840, he had reached the kingdom of 'King' Wepiha, the American pork and timber trader. King Wepiha fired the young Scottish doctor with enthusiasm for the breathtaking Waitemata Harbour as the future capital of New Zealand.

The adventures of the carefree young Campbell in search of his fortune are both thrilling and amusing. The romantic interlude camping in a Maori village; the drama and savagery of a chief's tangi; the mysterious tragedies of the law of tapu; the extravagant feasts; the wisdom of the highly intelligent old chief Kanini; all these make Poenamo one of the most stirring tales of the birth of a city ever to be told.",FALSE,,TRUE,20.00,20.00,28.00,FALSE,FALSE,28.00,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.5=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;13.50=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;2.00=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;0.00=Pick up No Cost Or Combined Shipping;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2025-03-15 17.43.27.jpg;2024-12-14 07.11.45.jpg;2024-12-14 07.12.02.jpg;2025-03-15 17.43.45.jpg;2025-03-15 17.46.00.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"Week 6",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway. New Zealand's First 3ft. 6in. Gauge Line by T. A. McGavin. 'Although New Zealand's first railways were built 1862 and 1864, it was the end of that decade before serious thoughts were being given to the development of a railway system in a national sense. 


These thoughts were crystallised in Julius Vogel's famous immigration and public works proposals of June 1870, which embodied the adoption of a standard 3ft. 6in. gauge railway for practically all future railway construction in the country. 


Meanwhile, in 1869, plans had been prepared in Dunedin for a 4ft. 8.5in. gauge railway to Port Chalmers, but under the influence of the national proposals it was actually built to the narrower gauge. 

Thus it came about that a provincially inspired railway project became the first in New Zealand to use the new standard of 3ft. 6in. gauge, and ultimately to become an important part of the country's railway system.'

The New Zealand Wars uncover the conflicts between Maori and Pakeha in the last century when a small group of tribal people clashed with the world's largest empire. The struggle for British sovereignty over mana Maori is a story of racism and heroism, grief and triumph, flowering myths and stunted truths. For most New Zealanders, the story has not been told.

In 1911, she responded to Tawhiao's call to duty, and had her first taste of politics in an election campaign. Her leadership in the Kingitanga movement thus became established & she became determined to create a centre for the movement. She began farming at Mangatawhiri and, opposed to the introduction of conscription in 1917, opened her farm as a refuge for those who chose not to enlist. She recognised the importance of making the best possible use of Waikato land in order to rebuild both the mana & economic strength of her people & her skills in organisation and her own hard physical work earned widespread respect. After the devastating influenza epidemic of 1918, she gathered up 100 orphaned children and founded the community at Ngaruawahia now known as Turangawaewae ... 

Over many years Te Puea Herangi played a leading role in negotiating settlements for the confiscation of Waikato land, and achieved a measure of financial compensation which enabled her people to pursue economic and educational goals. She had grown up with poignant memories of the effects of war and land confiscation in the 1860s, but was committed to overcoming the alienation of her people. She worked closely with the Pakeha world to achieve true partnership, and her energy, creativity, discipline, and vision made her a distinguished leader. 

Te Puea Herangi, whom Professor John Pocock identified as ' possibly the most influential woman in our political history ', wanted an honest biography of her turbulent life. 
' I want the truth told and nothing but the truth, ' she told a Pakeha journalist. Michael King has written such a book. He did so with the full support of Te Puea's tribe, Tainui, and of her surviving family and proteges

By Dave Blair 2001  - No Inscriptions

Dave Blair is “The Hedgehog Kid.”

“I came into the world of wildlife as a five-year-old when my father bought an 83 acre farm in Taranaki.  It was a place where Maori could not live.  Tarurutangi, ‘The land of the crying owl’.  It was here I began to live in the world of animals and birds and begin an adventure life because of them.  They became my escape.

“From the moment I saw the hawk in the sky, I wanted to fly.  With my over imaginative friend Lawrence, it became our dream, along with our adventurous dreams, to travel to and hunt in Canada and Africa.  Lawrence died young, so his dream to hunt the world died with him.  Lawrence did realize his dream to fly, and he did it first and magnificently.

“For money we hunted hedgehogs at shilling a snout, so they called us “The Hedgehog Kids.”  We escaped education in the countryside.  Under-aged I joined the army to fight in the Middle East, to escape to adventure, but the ware was won in a week, instead I went to the city.

“There, I worked on the railways and wharves, in the freezing works, at a brass foundry and a fertilizer works.  I became a motelier and a farmer, a hunting and tourist guide.  I came to see all of the places we had dreamed of as boys and as men.  I made and lost my fortune and almost my life, but never lost my love of wild places, or of what matters most for all of us, rich or poor, of life itself.”

Dreams do come true!

HMS Neptune was a Leander-class light cruiser of the Royal Navy, launched in 1933. Tragically, it was sunk on December 19, 1941, after striking mines off the coast of Tripoli during World War II. This incident resulted in the loss of 764 lives, including 150 New Zealanders, making it New Zealand's worst naval tragedy.

The ship had a distinguished service history before its loss, including operations in the South Atlantic and the Mediterranean. It was part of Force K, a Malta-based naval unit, and played a role in intercepting enemy supply convoys

This is the untold war story of the railwaymen who built and ran the desert railway in North Africa and the Middle East during World War II. In 1940 as the Second World War developed, the New Zealand government called for volunteers from the country's railwaymen to go to North Africa to build and operate a railway system in the Western Desert. 

Some 1300 Kiwi railwaymen answered the call. From the beginning they were unlikely military men. Although they were called 'sappers', they certainly weren't soldiers. They were also older than the usual young soldier - some had fought in the First World War, at least one at Gallipoli and several had sons serving as soldiers.

 In the desert, railway lines became the prime means of transporting men, equipment and supplies, sometimes to within a few thousand metres of the line of battle. 

Running the trains was just as dangerous as fighting on the front line as the Germans were determined to disable this strategic operation. Their adventure culminated in the Battle of Alamein. 

This is the untold story of railwaymen at war who made a significant contribution to the Allied victory in North Africa.

2014 First edition

From a Charming Creek childhood, a Buller coal miner to Heathcote Valley multi-millionaire, the story of cleaning king and Canterbury hardcase identity George Calvert. With the history of the Buller mines, digging beneath Manapouri for the power project with later Mayor Tim Shadbolt, in the jungles of Malaya and Borneo, boxing promoter. 

The George Calvert narrative has enough backblocks-Kiwi tenacity, overcome-the-odds success and rough-edged charm and magic to more than warrant its recording. Such charm as.evading the Russian mafia in a Prague casino by shooting thru the roof of the taxi; taking on one of New Zealand's biggest financial advisory giants; sleeping in a helicopter in a Nevada desert while a con-artist wanders outside; first Cantabrian to completely rebuild a quake-devastated pub; chartering a DC3 to fly to Westport to watch a horse race named after his father; sitting ringside, chomping on the end of a cigar the size of a dog-roll, while Evander Holyfield had a chunk of his right ear bitten off and spat onto the canvas by Mike Tyson. The photographs include many historic and current Buller/West Coast scenes, an extensive compilation from the depths of the Manapouri Project, world-renowned boxing identities and personalities and the effects of the Canterbury earthquake

. It also includes one of the largest spreads of on-the-ground photographs of NZ's armed involvement in the Indonesian confrontation in Malaysia & Borneo.

Pick up virtually any textbook on vertebrate evolution and you will find mention of the curious reptile known as tuatara (Sphenodon). The special evolutionary status of tuatara as the last of the rhynchocephalians – one of the four orders of living reptiles – is unquestioned. Wild members of the sole living species are now restricted to a few dozen remote islands around the New Zealand coast, where for several centuries they have been observed and studied by humans. But are tuatara really unchanged ‘living fossils’, or close relatives of dinosaurs, as sometimes portrayed?

Tuatara Biology and Conservation of a venerable survivor
This is the first detailed monograph for decades about this enigmatic reptile, and the first to be illustrated in colour throughout. The evolution, natural history and conservation of tuatara are covered in comprehensive detail, providing a resource for the specialist yet in a style accessible to a wide readership. The special place of tuatara in Māori and popular culture is also considered.

The book details the tremendous battles these nurses had to face to get recognition and support which often came from the wives of highly placed military personnel, and other women of means and influence. The accounts in this book are based on diaries, newspaper reports and other sources. In spite of censorship, the diaries describe, often in graphic detail, the efforts that the NZ nurses made, not only in hospitals but also as ambulance drivers who needed a particular form of daring-do. The war did not only take place in Egypt, Gallipoli, France and Belgium, but also in the mountains of Serbia and Macedonia with their forms of deprivation.


This book finally details the enormous contribution that New Zealand women made to the World War One effort, especially as nurses and nurse aides, but also as the supporters of those nurses, both in NZ and in the UK. Jane Tolerton reckons that at least 600 nurses/nurse aides went to help in that war. Precise figures are hard to obtain because many nurses worked in British and Australian medical corps, such as the Voluntary Aid Detachments which were specifically British units of 24 volunteers, often used as nurse aides. Although women had obtained the right to vote, there was still huge resistance to women taking part in a war, even from the Minister of Defence, the Hon. James Allen.

In his book, Trevor portrays the struggles and successes of an ‘average’ New Zealand hunter, providing accounts of his public land hunts for red deer, wapiti, tahr and chamois, where he uses skills and lessons taught to him by his father, Trevor Bentley Senior. You get the sense the author has great respect for Trevor Senior, and the following quote by him is used to close out the book: “You won’t shoot any deer sitting in front of the television son”.

As the author points out, hunting successes are few and far between and just like in real life this book is more about all those weekends spent hunting when skills are learned and failure is more common than not.

The highlights include chapters about securing a trophy 10 1/4″ chamois buck in the Copland Valley, South Westland (on the same trip he proposed to his now wife, Mel), shooting a 12 1/2″ bull tahr while solo and deep in the Southern Alps, and taking a representative wapiti-type bull in the Dark River block during the Fiordland wapiti bugle of 2009.

The Butler House in Mangonui, New Zealand, is a historically significant site with a rich past.

Early History:
It was originally built in the 1840s by Captain William Butler, a retired whaler.
The house and surrounding area served as a trading post, playing a vital role in early colonial commerce, particularly with the whaling industry.
The location was an important point of contact between Māori, Pākehā (European settlers), and international trade networks.
Historical Significance:
Butler House is recognized for its connection to the 19th-century whaling trade in the South Pacific.
It's a valuable example of early colonial architecture in New Zealand.
The site holds archaeological significance, revealing information about early trading practices.

He was a Gunner in the 5th Field Regiment of the New Zealand Artillery.
He served in various locations during World War II, including England, Egypt, Greece, North Africa, and Italy.

The book compiles his letters sent home to family and friends, offering a first-hand perspective of his wartime experiences.
It includes his observations of the places, people, and events he encountered.

The title ""The Soldier Tourist"" comes from the fact that during his time in England, before being sent to the middle east, he and his fellow soldiers had time to explore the country. So they were somewhat seen as tourist.
It also contains his reflections and comments on his letters, written after the war.

The book provides a valuable historical record of a New Zealand soldier's experiences during World War II.

It was time for the annual albatross hunt on the Chatham Islands in this story of more than 200 years ago. The chief and his sons went out in their waka (canoe) but things went badly wrong when strangers stole their waka and they were left marooned. The chief had an ingenious plan. They plaited bird feathers together and made their own craft to sail home

. This is the first retelling of a traditional tale that was first published in 1904 by William Baucke who had grown up on the Chatham Islands where his parents were missionaries.

`In the year 1879 there was touring this country the Rev. J. Berry, an agent for the New Zealand Government. He extolled the virtues of that country and advised people to emigrate to New Zeland and there make their fortunes. John Hillary, a shopkeeper in the small north-eastern town of Tow Law, listened to the blandishments of the reverend gentleman and being sure that only truth could come from such a source, decided that as New Zealand must be `the promised land' he would act upon the advice given.'
The diary, reproduced exactly as written with comments added by the present John Hillary, paints a vivid and absorbing picture of the life and adventures of emigrants over 100 years ago, both on board ship and in the depression in New Zealand at that time. 

The second part of the book recounts the Hillary family's homeward journey by steamer only a few months after their arrival in New Zealand - having been unable to find work and the new life they had hoped for in `the promised land....'",FALSE,,TRUE,20.00,20.00,28.00,FALSE,FALSE,28.00,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.00=Nationwide, Non-Rural;14.00=Nationwide, Rural;2.00=Whanganui, Non-Rural;1.00=Combine with another item you've paid shipping on;0.00=Nationwide, Standard;11.00=Nationwide, Standard;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2024-07-28 19.37.51.jpg;2024-07-28 19.37.58.jpg;2024-07-28 19.38.06.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"Week 10",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

The bestselling classic guide to a more sustainable way of life from the father

Embrace off-grid green living and imagine a more sustainable future with the original guide to self-sufficiency.

For over 40 years, John Seymour has inspired thousands to make more eco-friendly choices with his advice on living sustainably. The New Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency offers step-by-step instructions on everything from chopping trees to harnessing solar power; from growing fruit and vegetables, and preserving and pickling your harvest, to baking bread, brewing beer, and making cheese. Seymour shows you how to live off the land, running your own smallholding or homestead, and raising (and butchering) livestock.

In a world of mass production, intensive farming, and food miles, Seymour's words offer an alternative: a celebration of investing time, labour, and love into the things we need. While we won't all be able to move to the countryside, we can appreciate the need to eat food that has been grown ethically or create things we can cherish, using skills that have been handed down through generations. This bestselling classic is a balm for anyone who has ever sought solace away from the madness of modern life.

 Official record of the work of the New Zealand Army chaplains from the New Zealand Land Wars through the Boer War and the World Wars, followed by Korea, Vietnam, Malaya and Borneo. Detailed and well illustrated, the text not surprisingly highlights the work of the service in both World Wars where the Chaplains gave not only their all for God, King, and Country, but also their lives. The chaplains went wherever New Zealand forces served and never shied away from the front line, doing much work to rescue and aid the wounded as well as their ""core duties"" of tending to the spiritual well-being of the troops. The text contains much detail including Roll of Honour, lists of Decorations, and Nominal Rolls of those who served

The book uses the symbolism of the Kauri tree, deeply rooted in New Zealand soil, and the Willow, an introduced species, to represent the intertwining of Māori and European histories.

Locke presents history through a variety of engaging formats, including diary entries, letters, reminiscences, dialogue, and verse. This approach brings the past to life, offering readers a vivid and relatable glimpse into the lives of people during that era. The book is noted for its humor and accessibility, making it appealing to a wide audience, from schoolchildren to older readers.

James Jordan started hinting in the same way that many New Zealand hunters do with trips to his local hills, firstly, with the local tramping club and then later on his own. He started carrying a rifle when he discovered deer in teh hills. His ability grows with experience and his trips become further afield as he roams over most of New Zealand' wild country. In his travels he discovers not only his own abilities but also an appreciation for the magnificence of New Zealand's back country and the freedom that being there brings. James Jordan is a New Zealander although not often at home these days as he travels internationally as a motivational speaker.

The book tells the story of sailors who participated in various sporting codes throughout the 1941–1980 era. They were a unique breed of human beings and so different from their civilian counterparts in that
they were trained military personnel, highly motivated and knew the true value of “esprit de corps” Through their absence from family for long periods they became “a family away from family” and their ships were their “home away from home” They played sport around the world, pioneered sport in many countries in those early days, lived in
cramped quarters and on a rolling platform, competed against highly rated state, city, towns, clubs, other navy and military teams.
The early history of sport in the RNZN has never been told and we believe that now isthe time to ensure that those fine sportsmen and women are acknowledged andremembered before it is too late. In 1942 Navy sports clubs and teams began to be formed and from that year on they have always ‘punched’ above their weight, battled
against the odds in a background of a never ending changing population in reference to drafts to and from sea.
Sport in the RNZN began at our shore establishments HMNZS Tamaki and Philomel where our dedicated Physical Training Instructors (PTI’s) instilled discipline, physical fitness, the importance of teamwork and sporting skills. At sea the PTI had to be innovative and ‘think outside the square’ in order to ensure that the ships companies were kept physically fit and motivated before they returned to harbour.

The Invasion of the South Pacific 1767 -- 1840 



WHEN Cook made his landfall in Matavai Bay on April 13, 1769, the population of Tahiti was probably around forty thousand; by the turn of the century not more than fifteen thousand were left, and by the end of the eighteen-thirties the figure was down to nine thousand. When the first fieet of eleven ships under the command of Captain Phillip and carrying about eight hundred convicts sailed into Botany Bay on january 18, 1788, the · aborigines were virtually the only human beings on the Australian continent; a century and a half later, their epitaph was to be written in the indomitable Daisy Bates’s Passing qf the Abarzgines. When Cook discovered and claimed for Britain the icy coasts of South Georgia, a desolation without a tree, he was amazed to find such a wealth of marine and bird life; in the ensuing fifty years the killing of whales and seals was to reach such a pitch that eventually there was virtually nothing left to kill. These three facts form the tragic basis of Alan Moorehead’s study of the invasion of the South Pacific between 1767 and 1840. During those years, so—called western civilization came up against ‘ primeval innocence in Tahiti, Australia and, the Antarctic. In each case, good intentions were to lead to disaster, corruption and annihilation; and, ironically, in each case it was Cook, one of the greatest and certainly the most humane explorer of his day, who · was to cause the fatal impact.

Richard William Pearse (3 December 1877 — 29 July 1953), son of Cornish immigrants from St Columb near Newquay, a New Zealand farmer and inventor who performed pioneering experiments in aviation. 

According to witness statements, Pearse flew and landed a powered heavier-than-air machine on 31 March 1903, some nine months before the Wright brothers flew their aircraft.[1] The documentary evidence to support such a claim remains open to interpretation, and Pearse did not develop his aircraft to the same degree as the Wright brothers, who achieved sustained controlled flight.[2] Pearse himself was not a publicity-seeker and also occasionally made contradictory statements which for many years led some of the few who knew of his feats to offer 1904 as the date of his first flight. The lack of any chance of industrial development, such as spurred the Wrights to develop their machine, seems to have suppressed any recognition of Pearse's achievements

At the core of the book is the story of mankind's complex relationship with this immense sea, which stretches for 9,000 miles from pole to pole. The Atlantic has profoundly influenced the lives of those who have lived along its shores, from hardscrabble pioneers in windswept locations such as the Aran Islands and Newfoundland, to the inhabitants of the great port cities of Lisbon, Rio, London and New York. ATLANTIC brings to life key episodes in this compelling human drama - the age of exploration and the subsequent colonisation of the Americas; the flourishing of transatlantic commerce and the rise and fall of the slave trade; extraordinary tales of sea-borne emigration during the nineteenth century; and the great naval battles that have left an indelible imprint on Atlantic history. Travelling by small sailing craft, container ship and general cargo vessel, Simon Winchester will journey around the edges and across the vast expanse of the ocean to report from the places that encapsulate its most fascinating stories. It is an enthralling mixture of history, science and reportage from a master of narrative non-fiction, and the definitive account of this magnificent body of water

Pilgrimage has always been a feature of human life on this planet and today it is the third most popular reason for travel. Although many Kiwis visit famous overseas pilgrimage sites, it is only fairly recently that they have seen the potential of these islands for transformative pilgrimage experiences. The impetus for this guidebook, a 12-year work of love, was the realisation that no equivalent resource existed for those wanting to explore local pilgrimage sites.

Selecting sites for inclusion in the book was challenging. Some were obvious, others recommended, and some discovered quite by accident. The guidebook does not claim to include all the sites in Aotearoa that have potential to inspire, challenge, disturb, inform or transform pilgrims. It is a selection only and one of its goals is to encourage readers to look with wider vision at sites in their own locations and neighbourhoods.

The true stories of the extraordinary women who visited New Zealand when it was a fledgling colony. 19th century New Zealand: land of Maori, mountains, fiords, forests and volcanoes - an exotic, far-flung frontier of the British Empire. It proved irresistably attractive to the intrepid Victorians.

 To get there, men and women braved ships and seas few would even contemplate today. Although they were 'lady' travellers, they were resilient gutsy women who, revelling in their escape from the polite parlours of society, hitched up their skirts and grasped a slice of adventure. 

One young traveller witnessed her mother being slaughtered: another was murdered. From the governor's lady to the conqueror of Mount Cook; from war correspondent to Victorian tomboy, the lives of these very early tourists have been captured in this work.

Last of the Whalers is the story of a remarkable man, Charlie Heberley, a story lovingly researched and written by his daughter-in-law, Heather Heberley.

Chgarlie and his mates-who could also be rivals-were the last of a breed of men New Zealand will never see again. Years before he died in 2000, Charlie became an ardent conservationist, blasting those countries which persisted in unbridled whaling, including that done under the name of 'research'.
The famous Worser Heberley was his great-grandfather. With whaling in his blood, young Charlie joined the Perano whaling enterprise. He soon became an acknowledged leader. It was a rough, tough and dangerous occupation, enlivened by constant pranks, and sustained by the whalers' code of honour. Last of the Whalers has gripping accounts of pursuits, captures and processing of whales in Tory Channel and later at Great Barrier Island. True to his past and engagingly linked to the present, here is a story that is unforgettable.

Born in South Dunedin in 1899, Phil Connolly worked as an engine fitter at the Hillside Railway Workshops until the outbreak of World War II. On departure for war he was described as 'one of the most prominent members of the Labour Party in Dunedin - a young man with a decided future'. Connolly commanded the minesweepers hms Deodar in the English Channel and hmnzs Moa on anti-submarine duties in the Atlantic and Pacific. 

In 1943 he was elected to Parliament and represented Dunedin West (later renamed Dunedin Central) for twenty years. He served a total of 27 years as a Dunedin city councillor and member of the Otago Harbour and Hospital boards. From 1957-60 Phil Connolly was Minister of Defence and Minister of Police. 

He was described as 'an eminent statesman and Minister of the Crown who devoted his life to the advancement of the people of New Zealand' and a man whose 'forthright honesty and unquestioned integrity, together with his wide experience of life, both in peace and war, had combined to make him an outstanding Minister'.

In 1844 the Auckland firm of Henderson & Macfarlane swapped a ship for some 18,000 acres of land in the Whau in West Auckland. Thomas Maxwell Henderson, the senior partner and a hard-nosed Scotsmen, then proceeded to tear out the tall kauri timber from the Waitakere ranges and mill it at Henderson's Mill on Henderson Creek. After the mill closed in 1868, many came and left, but some stayed behind to build a life and eventually even a town. And that town became known as Henderson. These are their stories.

Henderson's Mill is a must-have reference work of both the history and the family names that contributed to the early district out West and the town of Henderson and its surrounding area, out as far as Helensville. It should be on every bookshelf in West Auckland.

Following the success of Australian Migrant Ships 1946-1971 this book examines those ships and shipping companies that transported migrants to Australia and New Zealand from 1900 to 1939, the outbreak of World War II. It examines where they were built, by whom, their tonnage, dimensions, service speed and propulsion, when and where they were launched and the history of their migrant-carrying voyages

The Chatham Islands lie some 860 km east of Christchurch, surround- ed by the South Pacific Ocean. There could rarely be a more isolated place, in the 19th andearly 20th century, for young women to travel to as the wives of early settlers orgovernment officials, or to live as children. 

The beauty of the islands could be appreciated and there were many natural resources available, but it must have been a challenge to set up a comfortable home, and to become self-sufficient and self-reliant in such a remote place. 

Most met that challenge fully, caring for husband and family, assisting with station and community activities, welcoming residents travelling across the island and visitors bringing news from the outside world.

This book describes aspects of life on the Chatham Islands, from the 1840s to the 1930s, though which the women portrayed lived. Included are profiles of Anna Dorothea Regnault (resident 1846-1901), Maggie Regnault (1867-1927), Katherine Pattisson (1872-1877), Mabel Chudleigh (1881-1907), Sophia Moore (1884-1891), Louisa, Ruth and Madeline Cannon; Marion Danvers (1866-1906),
Daisy Blyth (1874-1945), Mate Harvey, Marion Gascoyne (1891-1897) and Joyce Holmes (1938-2000).

Interesting study into the growth of the hatchback that developed primarily in the 80s even though examples pre-date WW2. Colour and b/w photgraphs illustrate the text.

What makes these cars so wonderful is recipe used to make one of these little road rippers: Take a compact, light weight, yet practical hatchback, shove some chili peppers up its tailpipe, add in a heavy dose of suspension tuning and keep it simple and cheap to buy.

 What you end up with is a sensational performing car that handles as crisp as mountain air, is able to carry four normal sized people in great comfort and is almost as practical as a pickup truck. These little pocket rockets can and will out-perform much more expensive vehicles from the same era. Even today you’d be hard pressed to find a better performing car on tight, twisty roads, and I would dare you to find something as entertaining.

The 'mighty Kaipara' Harbour and its hinterland is now a quiet, almost forgotten part of New Zealand, visited occasionally by probably only a small proportion of the million people of Auckland living less than an hour's drive down State Highway 16 from Helensville.
In its heyday though, the 30-year period from 1876 to 1906, the Kaipara was the leading timber export port of New Zealand and a vital contributor to the young colony's economy. The hills rang to the sound of axes and saws as settlers, local Maori and itinerant bushmen plundered the kauri forests for the golden timber that helped build cities like Wellington, Christchurch, Auckland, Sydney and Melbourne. The waters of this immense harbour, one of the largest in the southern hemisphere, were crowded with the tall spars of sailing ships laden with timber and steamers ferrying passengers from the distant reaches of the Kaipara.

Timber was not the only magnet drawing people into the region. Over thousands of years, ancient kauri had given up another treasure in the form of solid resin gum, which found a commercial use in the second half of the 19th century, particularly in the varnish and linoleum industries. Diggers from many countries converged on the Kaipara at this time to prowl its valleys and lowlands, seeking at first nuggets scattered on the ground. When those supplies dwindled, the diggers returned armed with spades and steel spears which they used to locate the buried nuggets of gum.

It was seven years before Annie saw another woman, but even a broken leg wouldn't later tear her away.

Our Land in Colour celebrates the rich story of Aotearoa through the restoration of images never before seen in colour. Two hundred images have been meticulously colourised, opening a window back in time with remarkable detail.

""The Long White Cloud"" has had greater influence on New Zealanders views of themselves and their past than any other book published, Written when William Pember Reeves was New Zealand's Agent- General in London. 

The book examines the arrival of European settlers and the transformation of New Zealand into a British colony.
Reeves discusses interactions between Māori and European settlers, including land disputes and cultural exchanges.

It is a history in which adventure and romance have not been ignored. In Reeves' own words the book deals with 'the poetry and ferocity of the Maori and the gallant drama of their struggle against the overwhelming strength of the Pakeha; the adventures of the gold seekers and other pioneers; the high aims of the colony's founders and the venturesome democratic experiments of those who succeeded them.'

Revealing the enormous tactical and military skill of Maori, and the inability of the ‘Victorian interpretation of racial conflict’ to acknowledge those qualities, Belich’s account of the New Zealand Wars offered a very different picture from the one previously given in historical works. 

Maori, in Belich’s view, won the Northern War and stalemated the British in the Taranaki War of 1860–61 only to be defeated by 18,000 British troops in the Waikato War of 1863–64. The secret of effective Maori resistance was an innovative military system, the modern pa, a trench-and-bunker fortification of a sophistication not achieved in Europe until 1915. 

According to the author: ‘The degree of Maori success in all four major wars is still underestimated – even to the point where, in the case of one war, the wrong side is said to have won.’

When John Logan Campbell landed on the shores of Coromandel Harbour in 1840, he had reached the kingdom of 'King' Wepiha, the American pork and timber trader. King Wepiha fired the young Scottish doctor with enthusiasm for the breathtaking Waitemata Harbour as the future capital of New Zealand.

The adventures of the carefree young Campbell in search of his fortune are both thrilling and amusing. The romantic interlude camping in a Maori village; the drama and savagery of a chief's tangi; the mysterious tragedies of the law of tapu; the extravagant feasts; the wisdom of the highly intelligent old chief Kanini; all these make Poenamo one of the most stirring tales of the birth of a city ever to be told.",FALSE,,TRUE,16.00,16.00,20.00,FALSE,FALSE,20.00,1 day,,FALSE,7 day,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,"8.50=Nationwide Courier Tracked - NON RURAL No P O Box;14.00=Nationwide Courier Tracked - RURAL Only;2.00=Drop Off Whanganui Central - NOT RURAL.;0.00=Pick up No Cost Or Combined Shipping;11.0=POBox Waiheke Island Stewart Island Pleasant Point;11.0=P O Box Address - NZ POST;",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,2024-12-14 07.11.45.jpg;2024-12-14 07.12.02.jpg;2024-12-15 07.57.32.jpg;2024-12-15 07.57.39.jpg;P1010873.JPG,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"Week 27",FALSE,TRUE,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,,FALSE

A Biography of Andreas Reischek Early New Zealand Explorer & Collector By M King

The Australian naturalist Andreas Reischek (1845-1902), author of the classic Yesterdays in Maoriland, came to New Zealand in 1877 for two years and stayed for twelve. 

He returned to Vienna in 1889 with the last great collection of artifacts and natural specimens to be taken to Europe from the South Seas - 14,000 items. 

After a brief moment of glory he died in poverty and obscurity. He has been hailed by some as one of New Zealand's great explorers and scientists, and he has been vilified by others as an accomplished charlatan who bribed and cheated his way through the Antipodes.

 The author, Michael King has set out to provide a lucid and balanced evaluation of his life and work.

In June 1843 the first group of organized German settlers arrived in New Zealand, beginning a wave of German immigration so great that for over a century the Germans remained the second-largest immigrant group after the British. 

One hundred and fifty years later, this book examines the significance of the German connection with New Zealand in the nineteenth century, considering not only the early German-speaking immigrants themselves (German, Austrian, and Swiss), and their settlements, but also the contribution of German and Austrian scientists, artists, musicians, businessmen, and missionaries to the New Zealand way of life. 

Conscious that a definitive study of this topic is long overdue, James N. Bade and his team of specialist contributors give comprehensive coverage of all the key areas. 

The result is a lively volume, generously illustrated, which will be of great interest to a general readership but will also provide an authoritative reference for those engaged in more specific research.

‘I have been told that my continuous rambling life
is a selfish wasted one & so it may be, but what
sort of life is a clerk’s or a merchant’s, a banker’s
or a timber sawyer’s, a carpenter’s or a tailor’s?
Why don’t some of these scribes write their lives?
As for mine, I could spin it out for many volumes,
for what? That’s just it. What is it all for?’

Harry Head was in turn a gold miner, explorer and mathematician, a pioneer of early flight, a painter, musician and raconteur. He followed his inclinations and disdained the trappings of an encumbered life in the fashion of a prototypical hippy.
The Extraordinary Travels of Harry Head is an intriguing account of one man’s exploration of the world in the 1800s, which included early New Zealand. He circumnavigated the globe seven times, all by sailing ship, by horse or train, but mostly on foot.

The Reverend Algernon Gifford, Edward Augustus Gifford, and Algernon Charles Gifford were three men who contributed significantly to the social, educational, cultural, geographical and scientific life of pioneering and early 20th Century New Zealand

The Rev. Algernon emigrated to New Zealand after twelve years in Labrador. He was the first Church of England minister for North Otago and during 28 years of service was charged with the building of St Luke's Church, Oamaru, and churches in Maheno and Hampden. Edward Augustus was a highly regarded painter in England and Italy before coming to New Zealand to join his brother.

 He was equally adept in oils and watercolours, and enjoyed portraiture and detailed figure drawing as well as broad landscapes. His contributions to the country's developing art culture have been reflected in exhibitions of his works, which are still held in New Zealand galleries today. Algernon Charles Gifford, eldest son of Algernon, was sent to England for schooling and University, returning to teach at Waitaki Boys' High School and Christ's College.

 He then spent thirty-three years teaching mathematics and science at Wellington College, where he was fondly nicknamed ""Uncle Charlie"". He was also a noted mountaineer, explorer, photographer and astronomer. Mt Gifford, Gifford's Crack and Lake Crusoe were named after him, and recently an asteroid was given his name in recognition of his contributions to astronomy

To the early settlers, frequently living in tents on the river banks, the Avon was the only source of water until seven artesian wells were sunk in Christchurch in 1864. The Avon waters were used by the Christchurch Fire Brigade, and cart-loads of water weaken to settle dust on the rough city streets.

The City Mill, on the island adjacent to the Hereford Street bridge, the Riccarton mill and the corn mill (commemorated in Carlton Mill Road) provided flour for bread.

Horses were watered, carts washed, people bathed, trout were taken by the basketful from inner reaches; rowing clubs built boatsheds and canoeists took their pleasure.

In From the Banks of the Avon local historian Robert C. Lamb brings history to life by recapturing the mood of the times, frequently drawing on contemporary accounts. He tells of bridges new and old, and events exciting, enterprising, humorous and at times - sadly moving in this very readable and superbly illustrated book.

 written by Henry D. Kelly and published in 1976.

""As High as the Hills""- this was the value placed upon the site of future Picton by the paramount Maori chief, Ropoama, when in 1850 he sold the land to the New Zealand Company for settlement.

But this centennial history of Picton begins long before, with Maori legend and the first Maori inhabitants, with Captain Cook and the early whalers and explorers in the Marlborough Sounds.

There have been many names and many plans for Picton. The Maori name was Waitohi but eventually the town was named in honour of Sir Thomas Picton who served under the Duke of Wellington. In 1858 Picton was proclaimed the first capital of Marlborough, and the ensuing rivalry with Blenheim embittered the province in its formative years. The Borough of Picton came into being in 1876.

As the port of entry to the South Island - ""the gateway to the South"" Picton has welcomed countless visitors. Today's holiday-makers have been preceded by a fascinating flow of people and ships, many of whose stories have been recounted here.

The people who made Picton, however, are the heroes of this history. As High as the Hills brims with their struggles, with anecdotes and names; there are more than 1000 entries in the index. Humour and tragedy, adversity and pioneering triumphs are all recorded.

The book is a memorial to those many New Zealanders who have helped shape and shepherd the development of Picton.

From 1867 to 1916 the Scottish-born Douglas lived on the west coast of the South Island, spending most of his time exploring, surveying and mapping the coast, the bush and the mountainous inland regions, in hazardous conditions, often for little or no pay.

He became to be known as 'Mr Explorer' Douglas owing to his extensive explorations of the West Coast Region of New Zealand and his work for the New Zealand Survey Department. Charlie Douglas was awarded the Royal Geographical Society Gill Memorial Prize in 1897... For 40 years Douglas explored and surveyed the West Coast Region of New Zealand. He was described as heavily bearded and with a slight frame, standing about 1.78 m in height. 


He was accompanied throughout his years of exploration by a dog, first ""Topsy"", then ""Betsey Jane"" and others During the colonial period of New Zealand, drowning in rivers was so commonplace before bridges had been built that it became known as the 'New Zealand death'. 

Douglas could not swim, and he once claimed that this fact ""had saved his life many a time"", implying that he would not enter rivers when it was risky...""

 Many years later the noted mountaineer and writer John Pascoe rediscovered and preserved many of Douglas's writings

Returning to New Zealand in 1947 he was soon in business designing and assembling mobile radios. This small enterprise was the forerunner of Tait Electronics Ltd, formed in 1969, in Christchurch, New Zealand, with a staff of 12 people.

From school he went into a radio store, before joining the RNZAF at the outbreak of World War II. He was then transferred to the RAF in England where he worked on airborne radar.

This team produced a new generation of lightweight compact mobile radios that secured a majority share of the New Zealand market within a few years.

An unswerving commitment to research and development enabled those initial products to be developed into the award-winning Miniphone series of mobile radios by the mid-1970s.

By its tenth anniversary, Tait had launched a range of portable radios and base stations, and was exporting over 25% of its production. The first wholly-owned subsidiary was opened in the UK in 1979

Published by Wellington Regiment, Wellington, New Zealand, 1982
Sunday Soldiers: A Brief History of the Wellington Regiment is a detailed account that captures the evolution, honors, and enduring spirit of one of New Zealand’s most storied military units. Compiled by Peter A. Lea and published in 1982, the book draws on a rich array of historical records, regimental memorabilia, personal accounts, and photographic plates to chronicle the journey of the Wellington Regiment—from its early formation as the Wellington Battalion through its active service during the First World War. 

This unit, which was raised by combining companies from several territorial regiments in the Wellington Military district, played a significant role in campaigns such as Gallipoli and later on the Western Front, marking its place in New Zealand’s military history .The evocative title, Sunday Soldiers, hints not only at the regiment’s martial commitments but also at the human side of military life—its traditions, camaraderie, and informal rituals that helped sustain the men through the challenges of war. A regiment steeped in a distinctive culture, highlighted by memorable anecdotes such as that of the Irish Terrier, affectionately known as Scout Sergeant Major Paddy, whose presence symbolized the resilient spirit of the unit. Richly illustrated with plates and facsimiles, the book offers readers an immersive glimpse into the daily life, the hardships, and the collective honor upheld by these soldiers

The themes are interrelated and both severally and in sum they provide a rewarding study of the special character that distinguished Coast politics from the outset. 

Much new ground is covered in each essay, with the authors presenting the results of recent research in their selected fields. This is particu-larly the case with Bernard Conradson's first-ever detailed study of the County and Province of Westland 'a rather sad story'. Again, Janice Lockwood is the first biographer of Richard John Seddon to look closely at his political career on the West Coast as the representative of an ageing goldfield electorate. The long story of the Midland Railway, with its high head of political steam, local and national, is absorbingly told by John Rosanowski. Then, with the em-phasis turned to the Coast's coal resources, Patrick O'Farrell and Len Richardson look with fresh eyes at the growth of unionism among the miners and their clashes with authority during World War I. The militancy of the coal miners thus rounds off a series introduced by Phil May with his neat summation of the touches of goldfield militancy that led originally to the separation of Westland from Canterbury Province.

Construction of the castle began in 1871 and unfolded as an audacious feat of 19th-century engineering and design. Renowned Dunedin architect R. A. Lawson masterminded a building that marries Scottish Baronial and Gothic Revival styles, using a striking array of imported and local materials. Workers employed innovative techniques—such as jamming pegs into volcanic rock and using salt water to split it—to prepare the site. Over the course of several years, around 200 laborers helped erect the main structure, which eventually comprised 43 rooms, including a lavish 3,000-square-foot ballroom added in 1887 as a poignant birthday gift to Larnach’s daughter. Intricate interior embellishments, such as ceilings carved by skilled European craftsmen, underscore the castle’s remarkable synthesis of global artistry and local resourcefulness.

Between Hitler and a Hard Place: A Memoir 1924–1948 is a compelling first-person account by Rolf Panny that takes the reader on a journey through some of the most turbulent periods of the 20th century. Born in 1924 in Hamburg, Panny paints a vivid picture of a childhood steeped in cultural richness—a time when swing and jazz filtered through the air, even as the ominous shadows of Nazi ideology began to lengthen over Germany. His memoir not only recounts personal experiences but also serves as a window into the ways in which an individual’s innate free-thinking nature clashed with an authoritarian regime that demanded uniformity in thought and action

 Following his labor service, he found himself assigned to the 30th Infantry Division—a unit that saw bitter, harsh combat on the Russian Front. In the midst of relentless fighting and unimaginable hardship, Panny describes how his individualism and quick wit became both his shield and his survival mechanism in an environment where blind obedience was the norm. His reflections expose the profound moral dilemmas he faced—being forced to either conform to an ideology he could not personally embrace or risk his very survival by silently defying it

Originally published in the early 1980s, the guide provides detailed descriptions of the diverse tracks and tramping routes that lace through the Paparoa Range and the coastal areas between the Grey and Buller Rivers. Readers find a wealth of practical information—from shorter walks along well-trodden paths to longer, more challenging tramping routes like the Razor Back road, Buckland Peaks, and the Pororari River valleys. The book also delves into special topics such as the region’s intriguing karst formations, its distinctive flora and fauna, and even the geological history that has shaped this rugged terrain. These detailed insights not only help outdoor enthusiasts navigate the landscape but also make a compelling case for establishing a national park to protect one of New Zealand’s last remaining unmodified lowland karst areas, renowned for its rich birdlife and spectacular features like the Punakaiki “pancake” rocks

At its core, the memoir is a collage of personal snapshots, anecdotes, and ephemera that document not only the rhythms of everyday life in a small town but also the larger cultural shifts of the era. Askew’s narrative is imbued with the flavor of the times: from the nostalgic echoes of the interwar period to the transformative years marked by his own experiences in the RAF and the advent of commercial television. This dual focus gives readers a sense of both the personal and the historical, as he recalls the idiosyncrasies of life during those decades—a period where industrial change met personal resilience and humor.

This book is an updated reprint by Selwyn Bridge Press in 2016, No Caviar for a Kingfisher has resonated with those interested in memoirs that blend personal history with a broader cultural context.

The Cruise of the Ruamano captures both the spirit of maritime adventure in mid-20th-century New Zealand and a remarkable chapter in the nation’s boating history. The narrative centers on a 44‑foot cruising launch—named the Ruamano—whose story was first chronicled in a 1926 Dominion newspaper article. 

According to that report, the Ruamano, built by Messrs. Collings and Bell and owned by Mr. A. F. I. Court of Auckland, embarked on extensive trials, including ventures to the Great Barrier, Moko Island, and the Mercuries. With a crew that included J. B. Johnston among others, the plan was to circumnavigate New Zealand—tracing a journey from Auckland through Russell, the North Cape, New Plymouth, Wanganui, and on to the Marlborough and Southern Sounds—marking an ambitious expedition for a motor launch in that era .

Later, the maritime escapade was revisited and memorialized in book form by Joseph Boyce Johnston, whose account—published in 1975—extends the legacy of that daring journey. Over the course of 85 pages, the memoir details not only the technical and logistical feats related to the Ruamano’s construction and its challenging outings but also illuminates the sheer enthusiasm and pioneer spirit that underpinned coastal travel around New Zealand. It serves as both a travel narrative and a historical document

Drawing on a life that included early hardships—such as the deep personal losses during the influenza epidemic—and the powerful influence of a close-knit, adoptive family, Pierson mixes intimate recollections with broader reflections on leadership and community service. His memoir serves not only as a personal record but also as a philosophical investigation into how experiences, even the most trying ones, can lead to profound personal growth and public influence.
The title itself, ""Life's What You Make It,"" encapsulates a timeless message: that through determination, self-belief, and the active choices we make, we have the power to define our own path. For readers, especially those interested in New Zealand history, personal memoirs, or inspirational tales of overcoming adversity, the book provides both historical insight and motivational reflections

A Man from the Ministry The Tales of a New Zealand Architect by W. Frank Ponder is a fascinating memoir that pulls back the curtain on the life of a government architect in mid‑20th‑century New Zealand.

 In this engaging narrative, Ponder recounts his experiences working for the New Zealand Ministry of Works—a role that took him to extraordinary places, from the wind-swept expanses of Antarctica to the remote islands of the Pacific.

 His tales capture not only the technical challenges of designing buildings under extreme conditions but also the spirit of adventure, ingenuity, and the subtle art of preserving history amidst the relentless forces of nature .
The memoir serves as more than just a record of architectural endeavors; it’s a window into the unique cultural and governmental landscape of New Zealand in the 1950s. Ponder’s narrative weaves together personal reflections with broader historical commentary, offering insights into how public infrastructure projects were both a reflection of and a catalyst for societal transformation. His experiences—navigating hurricanes, orchestrating complex construction projects with limited resources, and even engaging with early aviation and maritime challenges—illustrate the resilience and imaginative problem-solving necessary for such pioneering work

Central Otago, with its dramatic landscape and its climate extremes, provides a setting well suited to the story of human endeavour that preceded, and followed upon, the discovery of gold in its mountains, rivers and river terraces.
Before the gold miners came the explorers, men who performed prodigious physical feats, some in search of country for sheep and cattle, some for the joy of discovery itself. 

The Shotover, Skippers, Fox's secret valley, the Cardrona - these are the names to fire imagination of those who set out to travel the trails of the early gold seekers.

Gold 'fossicking' is an age-old tradition in New Zealand and an activity that has shaped New Zealand's history. 

A couple of recent gold finds in New Zealand and Australia have generated a renewed interest in gold panning and created a new generation of amateur gold enthusiasts to join the faithful who already enjoy the activity of fossicking for gold.

 There are over forty sites in New Zealand where one can pan for gold without a licence. Kiwi Gold focuses on these mini goldfields, describing in detail where they are, how to get to them and what to do when you get there. Contains detailed maps of both the sites and the picturesque tracks and paths that access them.

Major Robert Adams Wilson DSO, the second son of a Rangitikei sheep farmer, was brought up in a privileged and cultured household.

 Inspired by his Scottish father, a Member of Parliament, and his Australian mother who was a noted writer, Bob had an enquiring and innovative mind, a firm belief in science and a love for literature and the arts. 

He was a keen polo player and a forward-thinking businessman whose interests in sawmilling culminated in the chairmanship of two of the North Island's most important timber companies. 

He successfully planted and farmed a large area of Himitangi coastal sand country, and he established the highly successful Mahoe Friesian Stud, but his greatest love was for the rugged and isolated places of New Zealand. 

For nearly four decades he went deerstalking in South Westland and Otago, and after serving in the British Army in World War One he encouraged English sportsmen to do the same.

 He was an authority on native birds, joining ornithologists Edgar Stead and Geoffrey Buddle on numerous research expeditions to New Zealand's most inhospitable offshore islands. 

He wrote for a variety of newspapers and journals, and he bred lilies and rhododendrons. A high mountain pass, an island bay, several native plants and a rare southern fernbird were named after him, yet he had no public profile and was little known outside his own circles. 

This book tells the story of a twentieth-century gentleman who lived on his own terms in the Rangitikei.

In June 1843 he came to New Zealand on the ship St. Pauli arriving at Nelson, later settling at Motukaramu on the Mokau River in Taranaki and then at Warea in 1846. Among his pupils at the Warea Mission were Te Whiti and Tohu. He was involved with both European settlers and Maori during the Taranaki Land Wars.

In 1846 a German Lutheran missionary, J. F. Riemenschneider, established this mission station at Wārea among the Taranaki tribe. However, he abandoned his post during increasing unrest between Māori and Europeans in 1860. Because of his support of the European cause, the Māori people did not allow him to re-establish his mission station after the war.

Get ready to embark on a thrilling journey with Crazy Safari, a 1991 Hong Kong comedy film directed by Billy Chan. This movie promises an unforgettable experience, blending action, adventure, and humor in perfect harmony.

The plot follows a group of treasure hunters who venture into the African wilderness in search of a legendary treasure. As they delve deeper into the jungle, they encounter a series of challenges, obstacles, and hilarious misadventures that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

What sets Crazy Safari apart is its lighthearted tone, paired with impressive stunts and action sequences. The film's blend of humor and excitement makes it an entertaining ride from start to finish.

Fun Facts:

Crazy Safari was filmed on location in South Africa, adding to the film's authenticity and breathtaking scenery.
The movie's success led to a sequel, The Crazy Safari II, released in 1992.

This is a thoroughly bizarre kung fu action vampire slapstick exploitation movie, essentially an attempt to combine the success of two films, the excellent Chinese hit Mr. Vampire and the international hit The Gods Must Be Crazy (which for reasons unknown to me, was considered ""good"" and ""funny"" upon its release in the US).

The late Dr John Hall-Jones was an otago-based surgeon by profession, but a fiordland historian, pilot and photographer by obsession. He logged 50+ books on Southern NZ history and earned an OBE for heritage work. This guide compresses decades of field diaries into arm-chair-ready form—no glossy-tour-brochure fluff, all lived knowledge.

• Track alignments and hut names have barely changed (DOC has modernised facilities, not geography).
• His maps highlight side-spurs casual visitors miss—e.g., the Hidden Falls Track off the Hollyford or the Lake Hankinson–Lake Te Anau portage off the Milford road

In nineteenth century sailing days, whal-ing was an exciting and dangerous occup-ation. 
 The Cruise of the 'Cachalot' is the classic tale of whales and whaling, as seen by a crewman.

Bullen's extremely readable account describes the round-the-world voyage of the 'Cachalot', which spent several months in the Pacific and around the Australian and New Zealand coasts. Pursuing and harpooning whales from light boats just 12 feet long; exhilarating escapades when towed behind rampant whales; boats splintered into matchwood in seconds; the gruelling work of rendering down; all in the day's adventures faced by this hardy breed of men.

Imagine the Kawarau Gorge minus today’s highway guard-rails: river 40 m below, wagon wheels on ice, £3 worth of flour your entire fortune.

Author Helen Laurenson


Going Up, Going Down! is the second title in the new series AUP Studies in Cultural and Social History edited by Caroline Daley and Deborah Montgomerie

 A series of richly illustrated medium-length books, reflecting New Zealand's distinctive and sometimes quirky history. 

This lively account of the New Zealand department store with its stunning photographs will revive many memories of the delights of department store shopping, raise some smiles and remind us of the role of a cultural icon which was also a dominant player in the urban economy. 

This book revisits the variety, excitement and colourful stories of some of New Zealand's large department stores, most of which have now disappeared, although many of their buildings remain as unidentified inner city landmarks. Its chapter format echoes the rise and subsequent descent of many of those department stores, in a lift attendant's announcements of the passing floors. 

Helen Laurenson's extensive research has uncovered many fascinating facts about individual stores like Kirkaldie and Stains, Ballantynes and George Courts, and she also includes much of interest about the layout of the stores, the people who worked there, and the goods they sold.

This book is a simple biography in the form of re-miniscences, of ""Bob Mc-Latchie,"" a widely known pioneer, and the authors own father. His parents came out to Milton from Scotland in the 1850's - 1860's and the real meat of the story lies in his winning by ballot a block of virgin bush in the Owaka district, when the Seddon Government was breaking in new lands.

Although there are many facts and incidents recorded, the real value of the book lies in its authenticity as a social document. Here in detail is an account of the primitive beginnings of a New Zealand farm. As a teenager, McLatchie carried his first supplies into the bush, felled his first clear-ing, came to know and under-stand the natural life of the rain forest, and by tremen-dous personal effort changed a rotting forest on the hills into a productive farm. There is an incredible simplicity about it all. One man against the giant trees, finding food with a gun, creating a warm fellowship with others scattered through the bush.

Stewart served in the campaign as a pilot with the Royal Air Force flying Mark 8 Wellington aircraft.  

After training with the Royal New Zealand Air Force, he was posted overseas and joined up with the RAF.  He served with distinction as a pilot and was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross during operations in Malta. 

He has often told the story about having to ditch in the sea during the war as a result of engine failure.  Stewart and his squadron were trained for coastal command and search missions and to locate enemy shipping, including U boats.  With an engine failure an hour out from Sicily, the crew sent out a mayday call, and Stewart managed to put the Wellington down on a good sea.  

The tail touched the water and then the aircraft nose-dived and all went quiet.  “I thought at first, this is heaven.  My co-pilot and I got up out of the aircraft and stepped onto a life raft without even getting wet”.  They were fortunately rescued by an allied ship and within a few days were back on active service.

It sounds like you're referring to Soldiering On: The Australian Army at Home and Overseas, a compelling collection of stories written by Australian soldiers during World War II.

This book captures the lived experiences of troops stationed in places like the Middle East, Malaya, New Guinea, and even back home in Australia.

What makes it especially powerful is that the stories were written “in the field in brief hours off duty,” often by the flickering light of a hurricane lamp—giving it a raw, authentic voice. The book includes vivid sketches, maps, and photographs, and it paints a picture of both the hardship and camaraderie of wartime life.

If you're into military history or personal wartime narratives, this one’s a gem.

The members of the syndicate were responsible for a string of dead bodies all over the world and the importation of hundreds of kilograms of heroin and marijuana into Australia, New Zealand and Britain - and they made tens of millions of dollars doing it.


In this never before heard story from the only surviving member of the syndicate, James Shepherd tells of Mr Asia's rise and fall in gritty, horrifying detail. This is not the flashy, glamourised account put forward in Underbelly, but raw, unadulterated truth.

Mona Anderson tells of the wheat mills and the men who served them, of hardworking farmers and their equally hardworking wives and children. Of hot harvest days from the early 1850s to the time when tractor and header-harvester sent threshing-mill and traction-engine down the road in the wake of the big Clydesdales they had once supplanted.

 This book is rich in country yarns - of mischief and mishaps, hard cases and stealthy swaggers; and it also records the bonanza era of Canterbury wheat-farming. It mirrors a way of rural life that is all but forgotten now. The illustrations, too, are splendid. 

Mrs Anderson was just in time. Only today's oldies knew the mills at first hand. 'The Water-Joey' is a book for all lovers of open country life. It is also an invaluable record of an important part of New Zealand's rural history.

The United Steam Ship Company’s passenger service ran from 1875 to 1976, with thirty-six ships featuring in this book.

 Regarded as ‘queens of the seas’, they offered passengers excellent service in accommodation, entertainment and cuisine.

Drawing heavily on contemporary reports, the author has reconstructed the careers of these glamorous vessels which reigned supreme in coastal and ocean travel, through text and an extensive selection of black-and-white photographs.

An extensive selection of photographs attests to the remarkable standards of workmanship achieved in the fitting out and furnishing of cabins, dining saloons and places of relaxation. It seems no expense was spared in catering to passengers' comforts. 

Those who travelled on the Union Line during the heyday of ocean voyaging will find here a reservoir of pleasant memories. As well, this book must take its place as a valuable record of a bygone era. The delights of sailing aboard one of these notable ships are now things of the past, but A Century of Style offers the opportunity to reflect on their grandeur and the illustrious part they played in the history of transport.

 Includes tools, techniques and advice

The Complete Illustrated Book of Tanning Skins and Furs is a comprehensive guide by James E. Churchill that spans 197 pages and has long stood as a definitive reference for anyone interested in the art and craft of tanning. In this classic manual, Churchill details every step of the process—from the initial stages of skinning and fleshing an animal hide to the more advanced techniques required for tanning large furbearers and domestic animal skins. The book is carefully organized by animal type, covering topics such as:
- Small Animal Skins & Beginning Projects: Starting with modest projects like rabbit or squirrel skins, the book guides beginners through basic techniques.
- Furbearers & Buckskin Making: Detailed instructions for tackling small furbearers and methods for producing buckskin are provided.
- Large Furbearers and Game Hides: Methods for processing larger hides—including those of moose and elk—allow for the creation of sizable finished products, such as bear skin rugs.
- Tanning Reptiles, Birds, and Fish: The book doesn’t stop with mammals; it also covers the tanning of reptile, fish, and bird skins, ensuring a well-rounded exploration of the subject.

The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is home to New Zealand’s rich collections. Here are taonga (treasures) prized by many iwi (tribes), centuries of art from Europe and New Zealand, significant historical items, treasures from the Pacific, and many of the extraordinary animals and plants that make up our natural environment.

Almost 400 items from these collections are presented in Icons Ngā Taonga: From the Collections of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. From McCahon’s paintings to the Britten motorbike, from a waka taua to the engravings of Banks and Solander, from Phar Lap’s mighty skeleton to a rare embroidered sampler from 1853 – each treasured item has a story to tell. Together, they depict Aotearoa New Zealand and its people.

Full of newly discovered taonga and little-known stories, as well as familiar national icons, this is a diverse and thought-provoking collection that celebrates our unique identity. But it is also one that reflects the questioning, change, and conflict that have forged this identity over centuries.

Within the pages of Icons Ngā Taonga, hundreds of evocative photographs bring Te Papa’s collections to life. Each item is accompanied by informative, readable descriptions. A brief essay introduces each section and provides valuable background information. Sections are written in Māori and English.

Published in 1943 by His Majesty’s Stationery Office, the book was designed to showcase and explain the coordinated efforts of the British armed forces in amphibious warfare and other joint operations carried out from 1940 to 1942. It served both as a record of the innovative planning and execution of these operations—and as a tool to inform and inspire the British public during a challenging period of the war.

The publication is rich in detail, featuring black-and-white photographs, maps, diagrams, and descriptive text that illustrate how the Army, Navy, and Royal Air Force worked together to develop tactics and strategies for amphibious assaults, reconnaissance, and commando raids. These combined operations were a crucial component of Britain’s overall war strategy, laying groundwork for later large-scale amphibious operations such as those seen on D-Day. 

Today, the book is valued by military historians and collectors alike as an authentic glimpse into the early days of integrated military planning and warfare innovation

“Shandrydan – The Willow Flat Country” is a regional work that celebrates the hand of God in history, and its geographic reach is New Zealand wide.

The Nelson colony, Canterbury and Poverty Bay in the 1800’s feature among a variety of journeys that lead to this remote and lovely Northern Hawke ‘s Bay valley. Willow Flat, the station, neighboured another property that produced a major historical work, “Tutira”, by Herbert Guthrie-Smith, that influenced the author like a colossus as he wrote, so also the historical novel “Centennial”, by James A Michener and several stanzas of “Gorky Park”, by Martin Cruz Smith.

There are chapters on the tangata whenua, on geography and the dinosaurs. Astounding outcomes are reached after ten years of free time endeavour. There are some surprises.

he Woven Universe brings together for the first time, Maori Marsden’s substantial statements on Māori philosophy, theology and the Māori worldview. The collection includes his seminal essay, God, Man and Universe: A Māori View and an extract is also included from his final seminar delivered at Te Wānanga-o-Raukawa in Ōtaki.


 2003 Edition


Rev. Maori Marsden (1924-1993) was a tohunga, scholar, writer, healer, minister and philosopher of the latter part of the twentieth century. From the Tai Tokerau in the north, Maori was both an ordained Anglican minister and a graduate of the whare wānanga, the traditional tribal centre of higher and esoteric learning. He was uniquely placed to explore and explain the frontier between pre-Christian theology, understandings of divinity and the Māori worldview, and his Christian faith and vocation. His conclusions and perspectives on these matters are widely influential and speak meaningfully to his people whose spiritual welfare he was dedicated to.

Throughout his life, Maori was asked to speak and heal in Māori communities throughout the country and he wrote a substantial amount of material on matters facing the contemporary Māori quest for social justice and the achievement of authentic being.

In his writings, sensitively edited by Te Ahukaramū Charles Royal, Marsden's thoughts venture far and wide and include analyses and views on key concepts in the Māori worldview and knowledge, politics, science (particularly the New Physicists), the Treaty of Waitangi, the legal system and much more.

This original and thought-provoking book is based on the 800,000 word diary of James Cox, an itinerant laborer living in New Zealand between 1880 and 1925

Nearly Out of Heart & Hope is a challenging work at the forefront of contemporary historical enquiry and certain to create the same interest and debate as Fairburn's earlier book, The Ideal Society and its Enemies 

Cox's diary is a rare record of the daily life of a permanent member of the colonial working class - nothing like it exists in a New Zealand archive and little elsewhere. 

Rather than reproducing selections of the somewhat down-to-earth diary entries, Fairburn uses it more interestingly, taking the life of this obscure and unimportant man to explore in novel and ambitious ways some issues in writing and understanding nineteenth-century New Zealand history, colonial societies and working-class experience. 

A vivid biographical account of Cox's harsh and stressful life is followed by a reconstruction of his material world and his world of beliefs and ideas. Fairburn shows characteristic brilliance and innovation in his analysis of why in spite of a profound commitment to the work ethic Cox gradually slid further and further into poverty and why his own misfortunes never led him to question his belief in self-help.

Thousands of young single women came to New Zealand between the 1840s and 1880s as `government'  or assisted immigrants. In this remarkable study Charlotte Macdonald explores their life histories and patterns both prior to and after emigration and in so doing challenges many of our preconceptions about women's lives in nineteenth-century New Zealand.

The gripping autobiography of a New Zealand pilot's experiences in aerial fighting during the Second World War. He was placed among the top ten scoring fighter pilots in the Commonwealth and was the top New Zealander. 

An account of fighter plane experiences in the Battle of Britain and throughout World War II by Group Captain Colin Gray. He talks about his 500 missions over England, France, Italy and North Africa during World War II.

Gray’s leadership and outstanding ability as a combat pilot were recognised when he was made a DSO in May 1943. On 1 June he was promoted to wing commander and given command of No 322 Wing, based at Malta. Two more victories quickly followed, and on 10 July he downed a Messerschmitt over the invasion beaches of Sicily. His last successes were two Junkers Ju52 transports on 25 July. Gray’s final tally was 27 enemy aircraft destroyed, plus one shared, and about 22 probably destroyed or damaged, the highest for a New Zealand fighter pilot in the Second World War. 

He was gazetted as a squadron leader in September 1943.

The Coleman family, which was instrumental in becoming New Zealand agents for some of the world's top motorcycle companies, played a major role in motorcycle racing in the country and also establishing the internationally renowned Wanganui Cemetery Circuit. Percy, Rod and Bob all represented New Zealand at the world famous Isle of Man races over a period of a quarter of a century.

 Bob Coleman won five New Zealand one mile grass titles between 1949 and 1970, three New Zealand beach racing finals, two New Zealand miniature TT grass-track titles and two NZ motocross championships. On the road Bob Coleman was NZ 350cc TT champion in 1954 and two years later was fourth in the Ulster 250cc Grand Prix as well as racing at the Isle of Man.

Published by Flying Books Publishing, 2019

The story of New Zealand and its people is rich, layered and diverse. This is a place that many people have made their home. It’s a country that has celebrated successes that belie its small size. It’s also a country that has seen its fair share of heartache and dissent.

This is an easy-to-digest history of New Zealand presented in bite-sized chunks. Through the pages of this book, you’ll be guided through many of the key events that have shaped our nation.

The Bone People explores the potential within families for both destruction and healing, as well as the great personal costs of the disintegration of individual connections to traditional communities and cultures - in this case, the indigenous Maori culture of New Zealand.

The novel centers on a strange trinity of characters, each isolated, each spiritually adrift. Simon, a mute child surrounded by mysteries, is found on a beach and is adopted by Joe, a Maori man embittered by the loss of his wife and son and thwarted in his desire for family, religious, and cultural ties. The two are bound together by ""a bloody kind of love that has violence as its silent partner."" Simon and Joe come into the life of Kerewin, a part-Maori woman estranged from her family. She is a strong woman, compassionate and powerful, a sensualist who delights in color and landscape, food and archaic language, but who is also wary and conflicted. The three come together, break apart, experience great pain and loss, and eventual healing.

Ultimately, the family they create stands as Keri Hulme's assertion of vitality and regeneration for individuals, families and traditional cultures.

 Goldseekers and Bushrangers in New Zealand by John Rawson Elder, published in 1930. It’s a vivid account of the pioneering spirits who ventured into the South Island’s alpine regions, drawn by the lure of gold and the promise of new beginnings. Elder’s work blends historical narrative with personal anecdotes, shedding light on both the miners and the bushrangers—those who lived on the fringes of society, sometimes turning to robbery and rebellion.

 These stories are steeped in grit and drama - makeshift mining towns, treacherous terrain, and the constant tension between lawmen and outlaws. 

New Zealand had its share of colorful characters who blurred the line between hero and villain.

- Gold rush era in New Zealand, particularly in the South Island
- Bushrangers—outlaws and renegades who roamed the frontier
- Pioneering efforts to open alpine regions to farming and mining
- Colonial encounters, hardships, and the shaping of early New Zealand society
Elder’s writing combines vivid storytelling with historical documentation, making it a valuable resource for those interested in:
- New Zealand’s 19th-century frontier life
- The social dynamics of goldfields and lawlessness
- The geographical transformation of remote regions

"PR3086","local history Early Pioneers",1.0000,FALSE,1817,,"1000 Years of Gardening in­ New Zealand Including Maori Gardening / Storage etc",,"1,000 Years of Gardening in New Zealand by Helen Leach is a fascinating deep dive into the evolution of kitchen gardening across Aotearoa, spanning the full arc of human settlement—from early Māori horticulture to European traditions and beyond.

Here’s what makes it special:

- Cultural fusion: It explores how Māori gardening practices, rooted in tropical Polynesian traditions, merged with European techniques brought by settlers from Britain.
- Historical depth: The book traces gardening knowledge back to Southeast Asia and the Middle East, showing how tools, crops, and cultivation methods migrated over millennia.
- Illustrations: Nancy Tichborne’s artwork adds charm and clarity, with black-and-white drawings and a few color plates that bring the gardens to life.
- Rare and collectible: Originally published in 1984 by A.H. & A.W. Reed, it’s now considered a scarce gem among gardening and history enthusiasts.
It’s not just about plants—it’s about people, adaptation, and the way gardens reflect cultural identity. I imagine this would resonate with your love of blending personal and historical narratives. Would you like help weaving some of these themes into a story or memoir idea?

New Zealand has a proud history in motorsport & more than its share of driving heroes, but it is the inventiveness & practical ingenuity of generations of backyard builders & amateur mechanics to whom this history pays special tribute. In each of the great eras of our motorsport, extraordinary improvised cars were created by NZers to take on the classic names of international racing - the Bugattis, Alfas, Mercedes, Ferraris, Maseratis, Coopers, Brabhams & Lotuses - brought out by resourceful importers. 

New Zealand  became a living museum for the great marques. Long after their international careers were over, they would be raced here in the manner for which they were created. Sadly, the very high value placed on these rare cars saw most of them eventually sold overseas. 

Their stories are documented here in 'Historic Racing Cars of New Zealand', the first A to Z of New Zealand historic racing

 This book documents and celebrates the characters who catch the most-prized Kiwi food - the whitebait.

 Whitebaiters are a breed apart and photographer Anita Paters and Murray Hedwig have spent over three years travelling the country talking to and photographing New Zealanders about their passion, and documenting the, at times, complex unwritten 'rules' that surround it

- Photographic Journey: With over 460 full-colour images, it captures the rugged charm of whitebaiters across Aotearoa—from remote West Coast rivers to urban wharves in Auckland.
-  Authentic Characters: The book showcases the people behind the nets—those who fiercely guard their “pozzies” and spin tall tales about their catch sizes.
-  Lifestyle & Lore: It documents the cribs, shacks, and shelters, the diverse fishing techniques, and even includes 13 recipes (yes, proper whitebait fritters—no flour!).
-  Cultural Insight: With a foreword by Keri Hulme, it’s not just about fishing—it’s about identity, tradition, and the Kiwi spirit of perseverance and storytelling.

The Drivers is the first in a fascinating
series of books that capture the
remarkable legacy of New Zealand
motor sports' past, and indeed its
future, by looking at the individual

drivers on four wheels that made New
Zealand famous all over the world.
In a tiny country with limited

resources it is all the more amazing
that New Zealand has such a richness
of history in the global motor-racing
arena. Names like Mclaren, Hulme,

Amon, Murphy and Dixon and up-and-
coming drivers like Jonny Reid and
Matt Halliday have made an impression
on the media at home and overseas.

Many other highly skilled drivers
have made international history yet
barely created a ripple in their home
country's psyche.

The Drivers celebrates the contribution
of Kiwi racers' exploits to New
Zealand's outstanding reputation in
international motor sport from the
early 1920s to the present day.


McLaren, Hulme and Amon have risen above the radar in New Zealand with colourful tales of skill, success, daring and disaster. 

To have merely competed overseas, let alone excelled at any level in motor sport, is to have achieved something beyond our local comprehension. In New Zealand, motor racing is fun, and expensive.

 Overseas, it is deadly serious, expensive beyond our grasp and hugely competitive. Greg Murphy, the best known driver in New Zealand today, is one of many Kiwis whose name has been on the lips of millions outside Australasia, in America and Europe. 
 These include: Chris Amon, Craig Baird, Scott Dixon, Denny Hulme, Bruce McLaren, David Oxton, Aaron Slight, Paul Radisich, Greg Murphy, Mike Thackwell, etc, etc.

Kittyhawks Beyond the Gap is a quite different book, describing the operations of Kittyhawk aircraft beyond the ‘Gap’ in the Owen Stanley Ranges. 

These ranged from operations in support of the battle for the Papuan beachheads, then along the northern coast of New Guinea, through Dutch New Guinea, to Morotai and Borneo. 

The narrative inevitably includes much material on ground operations, the context in which the Kittyhawks operated, but there is sufficient on air operations to give a feel for them.

During research for both films, he collected lots of material which has never been published, and Burt's son also released Munro family scrapbooks to Roger, allowing them to be published here for the first time.In preparation for the doco Roger interviewed Burt and also taped Burt chatting to several of his cronies and coworkers. These tapes have been transcribed for this book, presenting the real Burt Munro in his own words.

Flora of New Zealand Lichens is the first volume in a series concered with cryptograms. 

Lichens, or lichenized dungi, are fungi which have evolved a specialized mode of nutrition, viz., symbiosis with a photosyntehtic partner (either green alga, or cyanobacterium). 

Lichens are primary colonisers in plant succession and are found, in New Zealand, in a wide variety of habitats from sea level to the summit rocks of mt cook.

It shows movingly and graphically that New Zealand soldiers were not inarticulate and insensitive ‘hard men’ but kept their sense of life before and after the war by the messages of love, hope and longing that they sent back home.

Vivid and evocative, this is a moving novel of a unique time and place from one of New Zealand's favourite authors.

The Whanganui River at the turn of the twentieth century is a busy thoroughfare, taking sightseers through the spectacular landscape by paddle steamer and acting as highway for the sparse scatterings of settlements along its twisting length. The people who have made it their home are a diverse collection, from Samuel Blencoe, trying to forget his past life as a convict, to the hoteliers at Pipiriki, the nuns at Jerusalem, the Maori families, the Chinese market gardener and the farmers, like Danny and Stella, trying to tame the wild bush. There's also Bridie, the strange, silent girl, who haunts the banks of the river where the accident occurred that robbed her of her mind. Like the tributaries that trickle down the mountains and join the mighty river, so the lives of these people come together in this vivid and moving tale of a stunningly unique place.

The Douglas DC-3/Dakota has had a remarkable history around the world for the past six decades. 

First built in the 1930s, it was an adaptable aircraft that filled a variety of roles: military transport, as a gunship, glider tug and air ambulance; commercial travel; freighter transport; and even topdressing. There are many examples of this timeless aircraft still in regular service around the world. DC-3: Southern Skies Pioneer tells the story of the DC-3 down under. 

This remarkable aircraft was first introduced to New Zealand during World War II and became a vital part of the RNZAF fleet. It carried everything from spare parts and mail to food and ex-POWs, and was involved in fighting in the Solomon Islands and support of New Zealand fighter bomber and flying boat squadrons. 

The DC-3 was the mainstay of New Zealand's commercial air services, for both passengers and freight, from the late 1940s until the mid-1960s, and embodies many nostalgic memories for generations of New Zealanders... It has carried VIPs, including Queen Elizabeth II. It also had a key role in rural areas as a topdressing aircraft. Today it makes regular appearances in warbirds' displays and in tourism enterprises.

Charlotte Godley left England for New Zealand late in 1849, with her husband John Robert Godley, a prominant member of the Canterbury Association, which arranged for settlers to come Canterbury in the South Island. 

These detailed letters to her mother in England, from 1850 to 1853, provide an important historical record of what the earliest settlers found, how they coped with problems. adversity, primative conditions and some hardship as they created the foundations of what was to become a major city, an economic and agricultural powerhouse of early NZ. 

Her letters were first printed for private circulation in 1936 and reprinted, edited by John R Godley, with his notes, for public release to mark the Canterbury Centennial year in 1951.

Kiwi heavy hauliers and house movers have long been famed for their willingness to move anything, anywhere. Over the past hundred years or so they have demonstrated an extraordinary ability to adapt trucks, build specialised transporters and develop innovative solutions. 

Their remarkable story is fundamental to the history of the building of New Zealand.

My great-grandfather came out from Ireland in 1875

He had a lump of land out here and was very good with horses.

He started metalling the tracks and roads around town and ploughing paddocks.”

The horses were in high demand for jobs such as hauling Sam’s reaper and binder through crops of oats, and carting dray-loads of sheaves to the oat stacks he built.

Some years after the bank account was opened for the business, Sam’s sons – George, James, and Cecil – formed the partnership known as Garrity Brothers, and as the business grew, so did the number of Clydesdale draughthorses.

Just before the outbreak of World War I, Garrity Brothers bought 80 acres [32 hectares] in Humphries St, Greytown, where the carrying yard is situated today.

At this time, there were about 40 draughthorses and many drays, spring carts, horse-drawn lorries, and implements.

If your programming experience is in BASIC, you may be drawn to assembly language by its
promise of greater speed and flexibility. Software development at this level requires the samc
approach to inspection and proof — the tempering of logic often referred to as the debugging
stage. In assembly language this process is much more focused since execution flow and register
usage is at the lowest level, in the Central Processing Unit (CPU), where the built-in protections
afforded by an operating system are not available. In many cases the best method to certify
programming logic is by direct testing. You need a tool which allows you to follow execution and
register contents at each step — a debugger.

251 pages

- Illustrations: Monochrome plates, lineage chart, portrait frontispiece

This biography is the first full-scale account of John Robert Godley, the visionary behind the founding of the Canterbury settlement in New Zealand. It explores:
- His early life and education in Ireland
- Travels in North America
- The formation of the Canterbury Association in 1848
- His arrival in Lyttelton in 1850 and leadership in developing Christchurch

It takes guts to be different in a small country like New Zealand but throughout history there have always been those who have stood out from the crowd and given character and innovation to our culture. 

This fascinating collection identifies many of those who did become the round pegs in a square society and includes pioneers, back-country folk, shearers, warriors, rebels, politicians, sports stars, entertainers, innovators and others who just cannot be defined.

 This collection is full of anecdotal wit, yarns, humour and charm that celebrates characters and individuals who have given an extra sparkle to New Zealand society

The editor notes that the original book, like the later one, was supported by sponsorship, and that one of the original sponsoring companies was also involved 93 years later in the 1995 version.

The foreword, by Ian Birch OBE, contains a poignant piece of New Zealand bowls history

From this era 1940s too came Jimmy Martin. This Carlton player won the New Zealand singles in 1945 and again in 1946. It was Martin who drew the shot with the last bowl he was ever to play. Seconds after the bowl he dropped dead on the green. The bowl travelled on towards the head, finishing inches from the the jack.

The main body of the book consists of 33 double page spreads featuring 31 clubs founded between 1862 and 1901. Typically, the left-hand page shows the title of the club, together with a description of its early history and two or more photos of senior officers, whilst the right-hand page carries a photo of the green with a game in progress or the members posed in a group shot.

If Britain was going to rebuild itself as a better place free from the scars of war  it better start with its children...after all they are the future.

Perhaps no better place to encourage this spirit and help create dreams in the minds of its youth than Cinema, namely, Saturday morning film shows.....

Millions of children regularly enjoyed the pleasures of Saturday cinema across the U.K. becoming a member of one of the 5 main cinema clubs.

This hardback Book was designed for those young club member enthusiasts of cinema

 126 colour and black and white pages including many popular stars and films of the period.

A nostalgic time-capsule of cinema, youth and new found club friendship.

This pair of vintage flower frogs is a rare and practical find for collectors and floral design enthusiasts. Crafted from lead and styled in the traditional British fashion, these spiked floral holders were once essential tools in arranging flowers with precision and stability. Their robust construction and aged patina speak to decades of use and craftsmanship.

The set includes two distinct shapes: one with a rectangular base and shorter spikes, and the other with a circular base and taller spikes. Both are designed to anchor flower stems securely within a vase or bowl, allowing for creative and balanced arrangements. These frogs were commonly used in mid-20th century floristry and remain highly sought after for their durability and vintage charm.

Lead flower frogs are especially prized for their weight and grip, making them ideal for heavier stems or complex arrangements. The spiked design allows for flexible positioning without the need for floral foam or wire, preserving the natural look of the bouquet. Their utilitarian beauty also makes them appealing as display pieces or conversation starters in vintage-themed interiors.

Collectors value these items not only for their functionality but also for their historical significance. British-styled floral tools like these were often found in professional florist kits and domestic settings alike. Their continued popularity among ikebana practitioners and vintage decorators underscores their timeless appeal.

This richly detailed volume takes readers on a journey through the remnants of goldfields, shantytowns, and remote communities that shaped New Zealand’s early development. With evocative storytelling and historical insight, McGill captures the spirit of places long abandoned but never forgotten.

The book opens with an introduction that sets the tone for a narrative steeped in adventure, hardship, and resilience. Each chapter delves into a specific region or theme, from the rugged Turpike goldfields to the transient shantytowns of the Grey River. McGill’s prose is both informative and atmospheric, painting vivid portraits of the people and places that defined these ghost towns.

Drawing from historical records, personal anecdotes, and cultural commentary, the author presents a nuanced view of New Zealand’s colonial past. Themes of migration, industry, and conflict are woven throughout, offering readers a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped these communities. The book also touches on the impact of Christianity on indigenous populations, the rise and fall of the flax boom, and the emergence of new homelands in the wake of gold rushes.

This edition includes a comprehensive index and bibliography, making it a valuable resource for historians, collectors, and enthusiasts of New Zealand heritage. The narrative is enriched by McGill’s ability to blend factual detail with engaging storytelling, making it both educational and enjoyable to read.

This compelling book by Michael Fowler chronicles the aftermath of the devastating 1931 Hawke’s Bay earthquake, which struck Hastings at 10:47 a.m. on the third of February with a magnitude of 7.8. At least 93 lives were lost in Hastings alone, with hundreds more injured.

 The central business district (CBD) was left in ruins, and this book captures the extraordinary journey of recovery that followed.

Spanning the years 1931 to 1935, the book documents the rebuilding of 15 city blocks in Hastings, each catalogued with detailed accounts of businesses, buildings, and the people who shaped the town’s rebirth. Richly illustrated with hundreds of previously unpublished photographs, it offers a rare glimpse into the destruction and the resilience of a community determined to rebuild.

The author tells dramatic personal stories, architectural transformations, and civic efforts that led to the establishment of a full-service hospital.

 The book is both a historical record and a tribute to the courage of Hastings residents. It is an essential read for anyone interested in New Zealand history, urban recovery, or the legacy of natural disasters.

The contents page provides a structured overview of the CBD’s transformation, organised by blocks and streets:

Hunters Forever by Bomb Grant is a heartfelt and rugged account of three generations of hunters learning, living & passing down the skills of ethical hunting in the wild bush country of Nelson, New Zealand. This 2003 first edition softcover captures the essence of rural life, family tradition & the enduring bond between father, son & grandson as they navigate the challenges of hunting in the South Island’s rugged terrain.

The story follows Sam, his son Sonny & grandson Bobby as they grow from curious novices into competent hunters. Through six seasons of basic instruction, they learn to track deer, read pig flow patterns & understand the bush’s subtle signs. The book explores the importance of patience, teamwork & respect for nature, with vivid anecdotes that highlight both the triumphs & trials of the hunt. Bomb Grant’s writing is rich with local flavour, capturing the spirit of New Zealand’s hunting culture with authenticity & warmth.

The narrative also reflects on the social impact of hunting, offering young men a path to maturity & responsibility. As Sam steps back, the younger generation steps forward, continuing the legacy with pride. 

The book is a tribute to the bush as a classroom, where lessons are learned not from textbooks but from experience, instinct & shared wisdom.

The Ravens by Christopher Robbins is a gripping account of one of the most covert & courageous air operations of the Vietnam War era. This edition reveals the untold story of American pilots who volunteered for clandestine missions in Laos, a country whose war was officially denied by both the United States & North Vietnam. These pilots, known as the Ravens, flew unmarked aircraft without uniforms or identification, directing air strikes in support of the Meo (Hmong) tribesmen fighting communist forces along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

Robbins’ narrative is based on extensive interviews, declassified documents & firsthand accounts, painting a vivid picture of the pilots’ daring missions, personal sacrifices & the bureaucratic obstacles they faced. The Ravens operated under extreme conditions, flying low & slow over enemy territory in propeller-driven aircraft, often drawing fire to mark targets for fighter-bombers. Their casualty rate was among the highest of any unit in the Indochina conflict, yet their bravery & skill were unmatched.


Highly regarded by military historians & aviation enthusiasts, the book has been praised by Tom Clancy, Ernest K. Gann & Walter J. Boyne for its authenticity & emotional depth. It remains a cornerstone of covert war literature.

The definitive account of the New Zealand air crews' heroic and often deadly role in the dramatic and dangerous invasion of Europe in 1944 to the fall of Berlin the following year. 'Just another name, another place, another time for dying.'

 From hunting U-boats over the heaving waters of the cold Atlantic to dropping supplies for the Resistance and towing the gliders carrying paratroopers and weapons at Normandy, Arnhem and the Rhine crossing, the New Zealand airmen who fought with the RAF played an extraordinary role in the final chapters of World War II. 

In Victory, bestselling author Max Lambert shares the vivid, inspiring and previously unpublished stories of those young fliers - some still teenagers - who lived and died in the service of their country during the invasion of Normandy in 1944. Commemorating the 70th anniversary of D-Day and the beginning of the end of the war.

 Victory is both a thrilling account of courage and sacrifice, and a moving tribute to a passing generation of true heroes. PRAISE FOR MAX LAMBERT 'Night After Night is a classic'
